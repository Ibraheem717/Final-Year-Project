Stefan Molyneux,"Between the poles of strong atheism and strict theism lies agnosticism, the argument that gods are very unlikely, but cannot logically be ruled out as utterly impossible. Agnosticism is considered a cautious, tentative and scientific approach to the question of the existence of gods - Stefan Molyneux's seminal book ""Against the Gods?"" makes a powerful case against agnosticism and for the positive acceptance of the nonexistence of supernatural beings.,It is not rational to even entertain the possibility of the existence of irrational entities. We do not accept agnosticism about unicorns, fairies, square circles, pixies on the proposition that two and two make five – why do we create a special exception in the realm of deities? Surely it is because the social cost of rejecting God's is far higher than the social cost of rejecting goblins.,""Against the Gods?"" provides essential ammunition to those fighting the virus of faith, and clears the mental fog of the irrational middle ground between atheism and theism.,""Against the Gods is a nail in agnosticism’s coffin. Stefan Molyneux is a pallbearer. Once agnosticism can finally and permanently be put to rest, we can turn our attention to an even more pernicious scourge—faith. Molyneux has begun this journey for us by making an extraordinarily contribution to the much-overlooked dangers of agnosticism."" - Peter Boghossian","Philosophy,Religion,Nonfiction,Religion,Atheism",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1336851516l/11540577.jpg,,https://goodreads.com/book/show/11540577-against-the-gods,60,3.79,13,Against The Gods?,181

Garrett Cook,"In a city ridden with prostitute furries, cannibal cops and warehouse-sized mob bosses, I've got my work cut out for me. My name is Jimmy Plush. I'm a private detective. I'm also a teddy bear. It all started when the original Jimmy Plush entered my life, offering to take my gambling debts away if I agreed to switch bodies with him. But I didn't know that being a three-foot-high plush toy would be such a living hell, especially now that everyone in town wants a piece of me. All I've gotten out of this deal is a faithful Chinese chauffeur, a custom teddybear .45, and a girlfriend who won't take off the fox suit she turns tricks in. Now I've got to keep this town clean and try to track down the real Jimmy Plush without losing my stuffing for good. Only one thing is for sure: Life is hard when you're soft.

Phil Scearce,"A Main Selection of the Military/History Book Club. During the early years of World War II in the Pacific theatre, against overwhelming odds, young American airmen flew the longest and most perilous bombing missions of the war. They faced determined Japanese fighters without fighter escort, relentless anti-aircraft fire with no deviations from target, and thousands of miles of over-water flying with no alternative landing sites. Finish Forty and Home, by Phil Scearce, is the true story of the men and missions of the 11th Bombardment Group as it fought alone and unheralded in the South Central Pacific, while America had its eyes on the war in Europe. The book opens with Sgt. Herman Scearce, the author's father, lying about his age to join the Army Air Corps at 16. The narrative follows Scearce through training and into combat with his new crewmates, including pilot Lt. Joe Deasy, whose last-minute transfer from training duty thrusts the new crew into the squadron commander’s role. After bombing Nauru, the squadron moves on to bomb Wake Island, Tarawa, and finally Iwo Jima. These missions bring American forces closer and closer to the Japanese home islands and precede the critical American invasions of Tarawa and Iwo Jima. The 42nd Squadron’s losses through 1943 were staggering: 50 out of 110 airmen killed. Phil Scearce explores the context of the war and sets the stage for these daring missions, revealing the motivations of the men who flew them: to finish forty combat missions and make it home again. He based his story upon substantial research at the Air Force Historical Research Agency and the National Archives, interviews with surviving airmen, and interviews and correspondence with the survivors of men who were lost. His is the first book to document America's bomber offensive in the early days of the Pacific War.","Nonfiction,History,Military,Military History,Aviation,War,World War II,Biography,War,Military Fiction",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1330478561l/11541265.jpg,1574413163,https://goodreads.com/book/show/11541265-finish-forty-and-home,352,4.16,16,Finish Forty and Home: The Untold World War II Story of B-24s in the Pacific,96

Rees tracks the movement of the film avant-garde between, on the one hand, the cinema, and, on the other hand, modern art (with its post-modern coda). But he also reconstitutes the film avant-garde as an independent form of art practice with its own internal logic and aesthetic discourse.,This is the first major history of avant-garde film and video to be published in more than twenty years. Ranging from Cezanne and dada, via Cocteau, Brakhage and Le Grice, to the new wave of British video artists in the 90s, this remarkable study will introduce a generation of new readers to avant-garde film as well as provoking students and specialists to further reflection and debate. ","Culture,Film,Art,Nonfiction,History",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1315713135l/1154177.jpg,851706819,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1154177.A_History_of_Experimental_Film_and_Video,256,3.81,1,A History of Experimental Film and Video,53

Clive Gamble,"Palaeolithic societies have been a neglected topic in the discussion of human origins. But in the past forty years archaeologists have recovered a wealth of information from Palaeolithic sites throughout the European continent that reveal many illuminating facets of social life over this 500,000-year period. Clive Gamble, introducing a new approach to this material, interrogates the data for information on the scale of social interaction, and the forms of social existence. The result is a reconstruction of ancient human societies, and a fresh perspective on the unique experience of human beings.","History,Prehistory,Nonfiction,History,Archaeology",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348910561l/1154209.jpg,521658721,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1154209.The_Palaeolithic_Societies_of_Europe,528,4,2,The Palaeolithic Societies of Europe,30

Lídia Jorge,"Há uma pergunta que percorre este romance de Lídia Jorge, da primeira à última página: Quantas vítimas se deixa pelo caminho para se perseguir um objectivo? A acção do romance decorre no final dos anos 80 do século XX e invoca um tema de inesperada audácia - o da força da idolatria e a construção do êxito - visto a partir do interior de um grupo, narrado 21 anos mais tarde, na forma de um monólogo. ,Como é habitual na obra da autora, a questão social é relevante - a força do todo e a aniquilação do indivíduo perante o colectivo são temas presentes neste livro. Mas aqui, tratando-se de um grupo fechado e dominado pela música, a parábola social submerge perante a descrição de um ambiente de grande envolvimento humano e de densidade poética. ,Servido por uma narrativa ao mesmo tempo rude e mágica, A Noite das Mulheres Cantoras propõe a quem o lê a história de seis figuras que passam a viver para sempre no nosso imaginário. ,A história de amor comovente que une as duas personagens principais, Solange de Matos e João de Lucena, é, por certo, um daqueles episódios que iluminam a realidade e tornam indispensáveis a grande literatura sobre a vida de hoje, com os ingredientes próprios da cultura dos nossos dias.","Romance,European Literature,Portuguese Literature,Cultural,Portugal,Fiction",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1307223911l/11542264.jpg,972204513X,https://goodreads.com/book/show/11542264-a-noite-das-mulheres-cantoras,317,3.12,11,A Noite das Mulheres Cantoras,147

Megan Vaughan,"The island of Mauritius lies in the middle of the Indian Ocean, about 550 miles east of Madagascar. Uninhabited until the arrival of colonists in the late sixteenth century, Mauritius was subsequently populated by many different peoples as successive waves of colonizers and slaves arrived at its shores. The French ruled the island from the early eighteenth century until the early nineteenth. Throughout the 1700s, ships brought men and women from France to build the colonial population and from Africa and India as slaves. In ,Creating the Creole Island,, the distinguished historian Megan Vaughan traces the complex and contradictory social relations that developed on Mauritius under French colonial rule, paying particular attention to questions of subjectivity and agency. Combining archival research with an engaging literary style, Vaughan juxtaposes extensive analysis of court records with examinations of the logs of slave ships and of colonial correspondence and travel accounts. The result is a close reading of life on the island, power relations, colonialism, and the process of cultural creolization. Vaughan brings to light complexities of language, sexuality, and reproduction as well as the impact of the French Revolution. Illuminating a crucial period in the history of Mauritius, ,Creating the Creole Island, is a major contribution to the historiography of slavery, colonialism, and creolization across the Indian Ocean.","History,Eastern Africa,Mauritius,Nonfiction",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1328864292l/1154277.jpg,822333996,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1154277.Creating_the_Creole_Island,360,3.48,4,Creating the Creole Island: Slavery in Eighteenth-Century Mauritius,21
"John Clute,Peter Nicholls,John Grant","When the first edition of The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction was published in 1979, it was immediately hailed as a classic work of reference. Frank Herbert described it as 'the most valuable science fiction source book ever written' and Isaac Asimov said 'It will become the Bible for all science fiction fans.'. This new edition has taken years to prepare and is much more than a simple updating. The world of science fiction in the 1990s is much more complex than it was back in the late 1970s. The advent of game worlds, shared worlds, graphic novels, film and tv spin-offs, technothrillers, survivalist fiction, of horror novels and fantasy novels with of centres has necessitated a radical revision, and this has allowed the inclusion of related subjects, such as magic realism. Accordingly, the book has expanded dramatically in order to cope with the complexities and changes. It now contains well over 4,300 entries - a staggering 1,500 more than the original - and, at 1.2 million words, it is over half a million words longer than the first edition. This is the indispensable reference work not only for every reader who loves, uses and wishes to know more about science fiction, but for every reader of imaginative fiction at the end of this century.","Reference,Science Fiction,Science Fiction Fantasy,Literature,Speculative Fiction,Criticism,Literary Criticism,Writing,Books About Books,Culture,Film,Reference,Research,Reference,Guides",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1311992208l/1154287.jpg,031213486X,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1154287.The_Encyclopedia_of_Science_Fiction,1386,4.35,33,The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction,589

Alan Barnard,"The study of human origins is one of the most fascinating branches of anthropology. Yet it has rarely been considered by social or cultural anthropologists, who represent the largest subfield of the discipline. In this powerful study Alan Barnard aims to bridge this gap. Barnard argues that social anthropological theory has much to contribute to our understanding of human evolution, including changes in technology, subsistence and exchange, family and kinship, as well as to the study of language, art, ritual and belief. This book places social anthropology in the context of a widely-conceived constellation of anthropological sciences. It incorporates recent findings in many fields, including primate studies, archaeology, linguistics and human genetics. In clear, accessible style Barnard addresses the fundamental questions surrounding the evolution of human society and the prehistory of culture, suggesting a new direction for social anthropology that will open up debate across the discipline as a whole.","Anthropology,Science",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1344753420l/11543708.jpg,521765315,https://goodreads.com/book/show/11543708-social-anthropology-and-human-origins,196,3.73,0,Social Anthropology and Human Origins,26

They can even improve our character, or at least strengthen our powers of self-control. In spite of the benefits that biomedical enhancements may bring, many people instinctively reject them. Some worry that we will lose something important-our appreciation for what we have or what makes human beings distinctively valuable. To think clearly about enhancement, Buchanan argues, we have to acknowledge that nature is a mixed bag and that our species has many design flaws. We should be open to the possibility of becoming better than human, while never underestimating the risk that our attempts to improve may backfire.","Philosophy,Science,Nonfiction,Science,Biology,Sociology,Medical,Academic",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1328034215l/11543794.jpg,199797870,https://goodreads.com/book/show/11543794-better-than-human,203,3.64,18,Better than Human: The Promise and Perils of Enhancing Ourselves,107
Bart D. Ehrman,"For years Bart Ehrman has been routinely bombarded with one question: Did Jesus Exist? As a leading Bible expert, fans and critics alike have sent letters, emails, posted blogs, and questioned Ehrman during interviews wanting his opinion about this nagging question that has become a conspiracy theorist cottage industry the world over. The idea that the character of Jesus was an invention of the early churchs time to put the issue to rest. Yes, the historical Jesus of Nazareth did exist. ,Known as a master explainer with deep knowledge of the field, Ehrman methodically demolishes both the scholarly and popular arguments against the existence of Jesus. Marshaling evidence from within the Bible and the wider historical record of the ancient world, Ehrman tackles the key issues that surround the popular mythologies associated with Jesus and the early Christian movement. Throughout Did Jesus Exist? Ehrman establishes the criterion for any genuine historical investigation and provides a robust defense of the methods required to discover the Jesus of history.","Religion,History,Nonfiction,Religion,Christianity,Religion,Theology,Religion,Atheism,Spirituality,Audiobook,Christian,Biography",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1328053160l/11543839.jpg,62089943,https://goodreads.com/book/show/11543839-did-jesus-exist,304,3.84,250,Did Jesus Exist?: The Historical Argument for Jesus of Nazareth,1667

Catriona Rueda Esquibel,"With the 1981 publication of the groundbreaking anthology This Bridge Called My Back: Writings by Radical Women of Color, Cherríe Moraga and Gloria Anzaldúa ushered in an era of Chicana lesbian writing. But while these two writers have achieved iconic status, observers of the Chicana/o experience have been slow to perceive the existence of a whole community—lesbian and straight, male as well as female—who write about the Chicana lesbian experience. To create a first full map of that community, this book explores a wide range of plays, novels, and short stories by Chicana/o authors that depict lesbian characters or lesbian desire. Catrióna Rueda Esquibel starts from the premise that Chicana/o communities, theories, and feminisms cannot be fully understood without taking account of the perspectives and experiences of Chicana lesbians. To open up these perspectives, she engages in close readings of works centered around the following themes: La Llorona, the Aztec Princess, Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz, girlhood friendships, rural communities and history, and Chicana activism. Her investigation broadens the community of Chicana lesbian writers well beyond Moraga and Anzaldúa, while it also demonstrates that the histories of Chicana lesbians have had to be written in works of fiction because these women have been marginalized and excluded in canonical writings on Chicano life and experience.","LGBT,LGBT,Lesbian,GLBT,Queer",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1347780078l/1154454.jpg,292712758,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1154454.With_Her_Machete_in_Her_Hand,263,4.1,0,With Her Machete in Her Hand: Reading Chicana Lesbians,30

  ,
, , ,Fifty Animals that Changed the Course of History, is a beautifully presented guide to the animals that have had the greatest impact on human civilization. Entries are organized by scientific name, except for Homo sapiens, which is featured last. , The 50 animals include the horse, dog, rat, whale, reindeer, beaver, flea, leech, dodo, falcon, oyster and shark. These creatures, great and small, have played central roles in the evolution of humankind, but they have remained at the periphery of our understanding of history. Whether it is an advancement in scientific knowledge, a trade war, disease and death, battles won and lost, or encounters with explorers in unknown lands, these animals have changed the course of history. , More than 150 elegant drawings, photographs and paintings, as well as excerpts from literature, highlight the concise text. Each animal is judged by its influence in four categories: ,   Edible -- animals that have shaped agriculture, such as the cow   Medical -- animals that are ""disease vectors,"" spreading bacteria and viruses, from malaria to plague   Commercial -- animals used for trade or in manufacturing   Practical -- animals used for transportation or clothing.    , The animals described in ,Fifty Animals that Changed the Course of History, are familiar, but their roles in human history are easily overlooked. This attractive reference gives us a fresh perspective on our place in the animal kingdom.

John N. King,"This book was first published in 2006. Second only to the Bible and Book of Common Prayer, John Foxe's Acts and Monuments, known as the Book of Martyrs, was the most influential book published in England during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. The most complex and best-illustrated English book of its time, it recounted in detail the experiences of hundreds of people who were burned alive for their religious beliefs. John N. King offers the most comprehensive investigation yet of the compilation, printing, publication, illustration, and reception of the Book of Martyrs. He charts its reception across different editions by learned and unlearned, sympathetic and antagonistic readers. The many illustrations included here introduce readers to the visual features of early printed books and general printing practices both in England and continental Europe, and enhance this important contribution to early modern literary studies, cultural and religious history, and the history of the Book.",,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348059252l/1154529.jpg,521863813,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1154529.Foxe_s_Book_Of_Martyrs_And_Early_Modern_Print_Culture,351,4,1,Foxe's Book Of Martyrs And Early Modern Print Culture,1

Bonnie English,"Over the past 40 years Japanese designers have led the way in aligning fashion with art, ideology and integrity, as well as addressing identity and social politics through dress. They have demonstrated that both creative and commercial enterprise is possible in today's international fashion industry, and have refused to compromise their ideals, remaining autonomous and independent in their design, business affairs and distribution methods. The inspirational Miyake, Yamamoto and Kawakubo have gained worldwide respect and admiration and have influenced a generation of designers and artists alike.,Based on twelve years of research, this book provides a richly detailed and uniquely comprehensive view of the work of these three key designers. It outlines their major contributions and the subsequent impact that their work has had upon the next generation of Japanese designers including Watanabe, Takizawa and Takahashi (Undercover), leading Japanese textile designers, and European fashion designers including Margiela and the Belgians, Viktor & Rolf and Chalayan.","Couture,Fashion,Nonfiction",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1316741352l/11545851.jpg,1847883117,https://goodreads.com/book/show/11545851-japanese-fashion-designers,192,4.2,4,"Japanese Fashion Designers: The Work and Influence of Issey Miyake, Yohji Yamamoto and Rei Kawakubo",50

Leonardo Vittorio Arena,"""Jing Ke estrasse la mappa e la porse a Ying Zheng. Rimase davanti a lui in ginocchio. Questi la guardò con attenzione, e cominciò a dispiegare il rotolo. Giunto all'ultima piega, la visione inattesa di un piccolo pugnale lo fece balzare all'indietro inorridito, Jing Ke fu lesto a impugnare l'arma, prima che questa scivolasse a terra. Con la mano, afferrò una manica dell'abito del re, preparandosi a vibrare un colpo micidiale."" Nel III secolo a.C., la Cina è insanguinata da lotte per il potere che oppongono i sovrani di numerosi staterelli. Tra battaglie, duelli e intrighi di palazzo, sono numerose le vittime di questa carneficina, che non ha riguardi per il sesso o l'età. Ma un giovane riesce a scampare alla strage. È Ying Zheng: in lui si compirà il destino della Cina imperiale. Fondatore della dinastia Qin, diventa un tiranno spietato e crudele, odiato dai sudditi, temuto dai nemici e costantemente a rischio di attentato. Sbarazzatosi dei due reggenti - la madre e il primo ministro, che forse era il suo vero padre - non trova ostacoli nella conquista dell'impero che lo conduce a porre fine a una guerra plurisecolare tra i diversi stati, sottomettendone ogni sovrano, fino a controllare l'intera Cina. A capo di un impero vasto e invincibile, diffonde la cultura del terrore, dando impulso alla costruzione della Grande Muraglia. Cultore di magia e alchimia, si guadagna fama d'immortalità e trasforma la sua figura in mito e leggenda.","European Literature,Italian Literature",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1451557798l/11545953.jpg,8838433763,https://goodreads.com/book/show/11545953-la-lanterna-e-la-spada,349,2.4,0,La lanterna e la spada,10

Nelson George,"""'These were philosophers out there, ' Kareem Abdul-Jabbar once wrote of black schoolyard players of basketball, the city game that is beloved all over the country. He and many others who have played the game over the last 50 years form the foundation of Nelson George's Elevating the Game. . . . George] has brought his own love of basketball to this folksy yet scholarly study. . . . He] examines the sport's origin . . . and charts its evolution from a kind of indoor football to an American passion. Basketball has been called life in short pants, and Mr. George recounts how, for the first black players in a game once reserved for whites, the phrase was no idle bromide. The author tells how black players from colleges around the nation advanced the game, sometimes in cities where people were opposed to the integration of basketball. Understanding the way in which black cultural expressions often knit together, Mr. George even likens basketball to jazz and to the nervous, insistent rhythms of rap. It all makes for a rich and welcome addition to sports literature.""-New York Times Book Review. Nelson George is a former columnist for Billboard and the Village Voice.

Harrison Geillor,"A small town... a plucky heroine, a shiny vampire, and a hunky Native American rival with a secret. But all is not as it seems in Lake Woebegotten. Let Harrison Geillor reveal what lies beneath the seemingly placid surface. You'll Laugh. We promise.,When Bonnie Grayduck relocates from sunny Santa Cruz California to the small town of Lake Woebegotten, Minnesota, to live with her estranged father, chief of the local two-man police department, she thinks she's leaving her troubles behind. But she soon becomes fascinated by another student — the brooding, beautiful Edwin Scullen, whose reclusive family hides a terrible secret. (Psst: they're actually vampires. But they're the kind who don't eat people, so it's okay.) Once Bonnie realizes what her new lover really is, she isn't afraid. Instead, she sees potential. Because while Bonnie seems to her friends and family to be an ordinary, slightly clumsy, easily-distracted girl, she's really manipulative, calculating, power hungry, and not above committing murder to get her way — or even just to amuse herself. This is a love story about monsters... but the vampire isn't the monster.,Skyhorse Publishing, under our Night Shade and Talos imprints, is proud to publish a broad range of titles for readers interested in science fiction (space opera, time travel, hard SF, alien invasion, near-future dystopia), fantasy (grimdark, sword and sorcery, contemporary urban fantasy, steampunk, alternative history), and horror (zombies, vampires, and the occult and supernatural), and much more.

All'improvviso il telefono squilla, la voce debole di un uomo che la chiama con il soprannome della sua infanzia: è Vito. È molto malato, e vorrebbe vederla per l'ultima volta. Carabiniere calabrese in pensione, ha prestato a lungo servizio in Alto Adige negli anni Sessanta, anni cupi, di tensione e di attentati. Anni che non impedirono l'amore tra quello smarrito giovane carabiniere e la bellissima Gerda Huber, cuoca in un grande albergo, sorella di un terrorista altoatesino e soprattutto ragazza madre in un mondo ostile. Quando Vito è entrato nella sua vita, Eva la figlia bambina, ha provato per la prima volta il sapore di cosa sia un papà: qualcuno che ti vuole così bene che, se necessario, perfino ti sgrida. Sul treno che porta Eva da Vito morente, lungo i 1397 chilometri che corrono dalle guglie dolomitiche del Rosengarten fino al mare scintillante della Calabria, compiremo anche un viaggio a ritroso nel tempo, dentro la storia tormentata dell'Alto Adige e della famiglia Huber.

Could everything we think we know about ourselves--intelligence and rationality versus emotion and irrationality--be wildly off the mark? Simply put: yes.,With these words, Denise Shull introduces her radical--and supremely rational-- approach to risk. Her vision stems from the indisputable fact that human beings can't make any decision at all without emotion and that emotion gets the first--and last--word when it comes to our perceptions and judgments.,Shull should know. She started out managing major accounts for IBM and then chose to research unconscious emotional patterns instead of getting her MBA. Next she became a trader and trading desk manager while continuing to study biopsychology.,We are all taught that sidelining our emotions is the best way to make good decisions-- Shull declares the converse: ""emotions inform us."" Attempting to control them actually increases the risks we take. Shull advocates treating feelings as data, and she convincingly argues that doing so eradicates the baffling question that repeats itself in our heads after making a poor investing decision: ""What was I thinking?"",Through a series of ""lectures,"" Shull logically but engagingly connects emotions, beliefs, and context to our innate reaction to uncertainty and risk (yes, the two are different). In ""Market Mind Games,"" she merges more than 20 years of studying risk decisions into a single, astoundingly effective strategy.,A reasonable approach to emotion is the best and only way to win the investing game. The methods Shull details in ""Market Mind Games"" shake the foundation of conventional market and decision psychology. And, most important, they work.","Economics,Finance,Currency,Money,Psychology,Business,Finance,Personal Finance,Economics",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348477980l/11547528.jpg,71756221,https://goodreads.com/book/show/11547528-market-mind-games,256,3.74,27,"Market Mind Games: Profiting from the New Psychology of Risk, Uncertainty, and the Convergence of Trading with Investing",215

They were arrested by the ruling Taliban government for teaching about Christianity to the people with whom they worked. In the middle of their trial, the events of September 11, 2001, led to the international war on terrorism, with the Taliban a primary target.

Ciro Discepolo,"A new book by an author that points to the practical use of astrological knowledge, while not disregarding the theoretical matrix from which it derives. A text to give testimony of a series of lesser and major discoveries gleaned from a whole life of studies, such as the correspondence between eyes & sight with the signs of Virgo & Pisces and with the 12th and 6th Houses, or the correspondence between the impairment of hearing and the sign of Aquarius - just to mention two specific items never noticed by other astrologers. This volume doesn't purport to be a treatise. It does not even claim to be comprehensive. The Author simply writes down the facts that he has been able to detect correctly within the framework of an immensely vast discipline. Nonetheless, this volume contains some theoretical-philosophical sections, such as the preface, containing interesting disquisitions towards epistemology, and the analysis of the 'incredible' paradox of the bumblebee - it should not be able to fly, but since it doesn't know that it couldn't, it does fly. This volume also contains short sections on neurosis and mental disorders.

  ,When and where did science begin? Historians have offered different answers to these questions, some pointing to Babylonian observational astronomy, some to the speculations of natural philosophers of ancient Greece. Others have opted for early modern Europe, which saw the triumph of Copernicanism and the birth of experimental science, while yet another view is that the appearance of science was postponed until the nineteenth century.,Rather than posit a modern definition of science and search for evidence of it in the past, the contributors to ,Wrestling with Nature, examine how students of nature themselves, in various cultures and periods of history, have understood and represented their work. The aim of each chapter is to explain the content, goals, methods, practices, and institutions associated with the investigation of nature and to articulate the strengths, limitations, and boundaries of these efforts from the perspective of the researchers themselves. With contributions from experts representing different historical periods and different disciplinary specializations, this volume offers a fresh perspective on the history of science and on what it meant, in other times and places, to wrestle with nature. ,

Sara Maitland,"There were three possible reasons given for the disappearance of the two hikers on Mount Nyangani: the treacherous terrain and climate, the banditos armados; the forgiving spirit called Chirikudzi. In David's case there was a fourth - that Clare might have killed him. Unable to remember exactly what happened on the mountain in Zimbabwe and trying to come to terms with the loss of her hand in the accident, Clare is taken home to Scotland where her large, loving, questioning, and uncomfortably acute family become almost unbearable. She had wanted David dead, but did that mean she had killed him? Her mother's High Church concern, Anni's sharp-tongued radicalism, saintly Felicity's internal fury, and her deaf niece Alice's fascination with the prosthetic hand seem at first to distract from Clare's problems, until the aristocratic family's pieties pierce her cocoon of post-traumatic amnesia. Family resentments flare and fade, divisions fester and heal, and as Clare uncovers buried fears, she comes to understand that the real question about the accident on Mount Nyangani is less what she has forgotten than why. Intricate in design, disturbing in its explorations of mind and spirit, and with a surprising twist at the end, Ancestral Truths employs a striking narrative voice to explore the shifting relations between belief and truth, love and desire, to reveal that beauty and danger walk hand in hand. Sara Maitland summons her knowledge of theology, mysticism, mathematics, and human nature to give this deeply perceptive novel its wit and cohesive richness. As Ms. Maitland's characters gradually recognize the inseparability of their strengths and weaknesses, the author of Three Times Table raises her art to a new pitch of excitement and originality.","Fiction,Cultural,Scotland,Death,Adult Fiction",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1312154491l/1155128.jpg,805037799,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1155128.Ancestral_Truths,295,3.46,6,Ancestral Truths,48

The book examines the transformation of the movement after the famous Seattle General Strike of 1919 by showing that workers organized not only at the point of production, but through politicized consumption as well, employing boycotts, cooperatives, labor-owned businesses, and union label promotion. It pays special attention to the gender dynamics of labor's consumer campaigns, as trade union men sought to persuade their wives to shop union, and to the racial dynamics of campaigns organized by white workers against Seattle's Japanese-American businesses.","Labor,History",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348641859l/1155236.jpg,521467144,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1155236.Purchasing_Power,349,4.05,1,"Purchasing Power: Consumer Organizing, Gender, and the Seattle Labor Movement, 1919-1929",19

Joan Dahr Lambert,"CIRCLES IN THE SKY, a prehistoric novel, is a tale of adventure, a love story, and a journey of compelling drama, tragedy, passion and courage, all rolled into one. The novel begins at the end of the first book in the Mother People Series, CIRCLES OF STONE, when the young Zena huddles alone and defenseless after an earthquake traps her in a tiny cave and buries her companions. Her mother is dead, too, as are most of the others in her tribe; she knows that intuitively. Though hardly more than a child, she also knows that it is up to her, as the next Zena, to find a new home for her people and to keep the ways of the Mother alive - the ways of love and compassion and respect for the earth that sustains them., This second Zena is an appealing heroine, a girl who lives in her mind as much as her body, but she also has a unique ability to combine common sense and imagination with mystical visions of the future that come to her from the Goddess. She finds many ingenious solutions to the challenges that face the small band of survivors as she struggles to lead to the new home the Goddess has promised them - like entrapment by the men with knives and the flooded river they must somehow cross to escape the danger. But when Zena loses Lupo, the young wolf who has befriended her and given her confidence, she is bereft. All her new-found courage seems to vanish when she realizes she may never see her beloved companion again. A near-fatal illness strikes, and only the mysterious appearance of an ancient and memorable healer saves her life, though Zena's body retains a permanent reminder of the illness., Other memorable characters abound in CIRCLES IN THE SKY: the old story teller who keeps the history of the Mother People alive; the crippled child who saves their lives, the young man whose chest is marked by a butterfly, symbolizing regeneration; the man who once killed his father in a fit of rage but who makes beautiful music on his bone flute, and the fiery young woman whose arguments about mating with the man who loves her disrupt the tribe’s stability. Zena watches the turmoil and is afraid, of the disruption within the tribe, of the men with knives who are still on their trail, of the fate of the small children who are mysteriously disappearing from Mother People tribes. But most of all, she fears a menace she senses hanging over them all that she cannot name but knows she must face before the tribe can continue their journey to the new home surrounded by a great moving sea she has envisioned. There, they will finally be safe., Then, when Zena least expects it, when she is alone with no one to defend her, she sees the unknown menace standing in front of her in the form of a woman so embittered by life that she has become the embodiment of evil. Her name is Veeta, and she has vowed revenge on all the Mother People and in particular on Zena. The scene that follows as Zena and Veeta finally come face to face will sear itself into your memory and tear at your heart, as wrenching and unforgettable as it is powerful. It is good and evil struggling for dominance in a prolonged battle of wills and mental strength, and all the advantages are on the wrong side. With Veeta’s knife at her throat, Zena's only hope is to use the solution she glimpses in pictures sent by the Goddess. All her senses rebel, but she knows that only she can do what must be done. This time, the survival of the Mother People as well as her own life, are at stake.,CIRCLES IN THE SKY is the second novel in the Mother People series, which began with CIRCLES OF STONE. A third novel, ICE BURIAL, will follow., ",,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1394323529l/11552512.jpg,,https://goodreads.com/book/show/11552512-circles-in-the-sky,353,4.28,10,CIRCLES IN THE SKY,284

Rowland White,"The thrilling new military history title from the bestselling author of ,Vulcan 607, ,and ,Phoenix Squadron,., ,In early 1970, the Commanding Officer of 22 SAS flew into the strategically critical Sultanate of Oman on a covert intelligence mission. A Communist rebellion in the South threatened not only the stability of the Arabian Peninsula but more importantly the vital oil routes through the Persian Gulf. Within six months, the Regiment arrived in theatre to lead a fierce, secret war against the rebels. While from a remote RAF airbase in the desert, an elite band of British pilots, flying difficult, dangerous missions in Strikemaster jets and Vietnam-era Huey helicopters, were scrambled alongside them., ,For the British soldiers and airmen, it was to be no easy victory. The enemy were well supplied with weaponry and training from China and the Soviet Union, and despite confronting the largest assault force ever deployed by the SAS, many months later the rebels were still fighting back., ,And at dawn on July 19th, 1972, a force of nearly 300 heavily armed, well-trained guerillas attacked the little fishing port of Mirbat without warning. Between them and glory stood a team of just nine SAS men. And the skill of the British fighter pilots. The scene was set for an epic encounter; a modern day Rorke's Drift. Their heroism would become SAS legend., ,Drawing on extensive interviews with participants from the SAS, the RAF and the Sultan's Armed Forces, most of whom have never spoken about their involvement before, as well as previously classified documents from both the UK and Oman, ,Storm Front, ,weaves an unputdownable tale of intrigue, action, daring and astonishing bravery in the face of overwhelming odds.","Nonfiction,War,Military Fiction,History,Aviation,Military,Military History,War",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1328043853l/11552919.jpg,593064348,https://goodreads.com/book/show/11552919-storm-front,364,4.09,11,"Storm Front: The Epic True Story of a Secret War, the SAS's Greatest Battle, and the British Pilots who Saved Them",170

This fascinating exploration of how information systems emerge takes readers on a provocative journey through the history of the information age.,Today's ""information explosion"" may seem like an acutely modern phenomenon, but we are not the first generation--nor even the first species--to wrestle with the problem of information overload. Long before the advent of computers, human beings were collecting, storing, and organizing information: from Ice Age taxonomies to Sumerian archives, Greek libraries to Dark Age monasteries.,Today, we stand at a precipice, as our old systems struggle to cope with what designer Richard Saul Wurman called a ""tsunami of data."" With some historical perspective, however, we can begin to understand our predicament not just as the result of technological change, but as the latest chapter in an ancient story that we are only beginning to understand.,Spanning disciplines from evolutionary theory and cultural anthropology to the history of books, libraries, and computer science, writer and information architect Alex Wright weaves an intriguing narrative that connects such seemingly far-flung topics as insect colonies, Stone Age jewelry, medieval monasteries, Renaissance encyclopedias, early computer networks, and the World Wide Web. Finally, he pulls these threads together to reach a surprising conclusion, suggesting that the future of the information age may lie deep in our cultural past.","Nonfiction,History,Science,Library Science,Science,Technology,Science,Library Science,Librarianship,Library Science,Information Science,Design,Writing,Books About Books,Textbooks",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1347720473l/1155302.jpg,309102383,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1155302.Glut,286,3.77,56,Glut: Mastering Information through the Ages,426
"Abolqasem Ferdowsi,Jerome W. Clinton","The tyrannical monster Zahhak upon whose shoulder grew serpents that feasted daily on the brains of Iran's youth; the giant hero Rostam who vanquished entire armies with his immense strength and military prowess; the inept Shah Kay Kavus whose greed and vanity brought incessant warfare and misery to the land he ruled; the bold princess Rudabe who defied two armies to pledge her love to the Iranian hero Zal--these are but a few of the charters who inhabit the world of the great Persian classic known as the Shahname, or Book of Kings. Completed in the eleventh century A.D. by the poet Abol-Qasem Ferdowsi, the Shahname describes in more than 80,000 lines of verse the pre-Islamic history of Persia from mythological times down to the invasion of the armies of Islam in the mid-seventh century A.D.,From this long saga, Jerome Clinton has translated into English blank verse the most famous episode, the story of Rostam and Sohrab. It is a stark and classic tragedy set against the exotic backdrop of a mythological Persia where feasting, hunting, and warring are accomplished on the most magnificent scale. Matching the English translation line by line on the facing pages is the Persian text of the poem, based on the earliest complete manuscript of the Shahname, which is preserved in the British Museum.,This lyrical translation of the tragedy of Sohrab and Rostam captures the narrative power and driving rhythm of the Shahname as no other English translation has.

Ivo Andrić,"Prokleta avlija/The Damned Yard (Description from Ivo Andrić Foundation website),The novel is written in 1954. Ćamil, a wealthy young man of Smyrna living in the last years of the Ottoman Empire, is fascinated by the story of Džem, ill-fated brother of the Sultan Bajazet, who ruled Turkey in the fifteenth century. Ćamil, in his isolation, comes to believe that he is Džem, and that he shares his evil destiny: he is born to be a victim of the State. Because of his stories about Džem’s ambitions to overthrow his brother, Ćamil is arrested under suspicion of plotting against the Sultan. He is taken to a prison in Istanbul, where he tells his story, to Petar, a monk.,Out of these exotic materials, Andrić has constructed a book of great clarity, brevity and interest. No doubt it will be read by some as a political parable about the tyranny of the State, but also as a quite simply story about ill-fortune and human misunderstanding, fear and ignorance. Džem and Ćamil are doomed – and the certainty of their persecution is sometimes relieved, sometimes intensified by the stupidity and fright of the people who cross their ill-starred lives.,Construction takes up most of the book’s space: the central story of Džem as related by Ćamil lasts only a chapter or two. For the rest of the time the reader strips layer off layer, as one narrator passes him on the next. There is an interesting passage that helps to explain this method, at the moment when Ćamil starts narrating Džem’s story in the first person. “I” is a word, we are told, which fixes the position of the speaker in such a way that the exercise of will is no longer possible, and the speaker strength is exceeded – strength, presumably, to break out of the identification that all his past actions and thoughts force upon him when he uses the word. “I” is both a confession and an imprisonment. The fact that the novel passes the reader on from one narrator to the next rather suggests that the author is taking constant evasive action, lest he betray himself or his reader into the kind of “personal confession” which seals the fate of Ćamil. What exactly this game of form flirting with meaning signifies, must be left to the individual reader.,The movement is centripetal, towards Džem’s story, and then disperses. Details within the story are made to mimic this form. Thus when Peter receives the message telling him of his impending release:,“Two younger prisoners...were chasing around using him as the centerpoint of ever narrowing circles. Annoyed, he tried to break away from these exuberant youths when one of them brushed against him and he felt a folded scrap of paper thrust into his hand. The youths continued their chase but now in widening circles...”,The reader is led on just such a chase in the course of the novel. The effect of this is to make the plot seem more like a poetic image than an ordinary plot: capable, therefore, of as many meanings as are the images of an allusive poem. Yet the language is simple and direct, not at all “poetic”. The characters are remarkable alive, even in conversation. Karađoz, the governor of the goal, is a spidery authoritarian, who loves to torment the charges he loves. The prisoners “complained about the way one complains about one’s life and curses one’s destiny...it would have been hard for them to imagine life without him”.,“The Devil’s Yard” is justified, as all symbolic and figurative novels must be, by the extent to which it touches the emotions. It is extremely moving.

Keith Roberts,"To understand business and its political, cultural, and economic context, it helps to view it historically, yet most business histories look no further back than the nineteenth century. The full sweep of business history actually begins much earlier, with the initial cities of Mesopotamia. In the first book to describe and explain these origins, Roberts depicts the society of ancient traders and consumers, tracing the roots of modern business and underscoring the relationship between early and modern business practice.,Roberts's narrative begins before business, which he defines as selling to voluntary buyers at a profit. Before business, he shows, the material conditions and concepts for the pursuit of profit did not exist, even though trade and manufacturing took place. The earliest business, he suggests, arose with the long distance trade of early Mesopotamia, and expanded into retail, manufacturing and finance in these command economies, culminating in the Middle Eastern empires. (Part One) But it was the largely independent rise of business, money, and markets in classical Greece that produced business much as we know it. Alexander the Great's conquests and the societies that his successors created in their kingdoms brought a version of this system to the old Middle Eastern empires, and beyond. (Part Two) At Rome this entrepreneurial market system gained important new features, including business corporations, public contracting, and even shopping malls. The story concludes with the sharp decline of business after the 3rd century CE. (Part Three),In each part, Roberts portrays the major new types of business coming into existence. He weaves these descriptions into a narrative of how the prevailing political, economic, and social culture shaped the nature and importance of business and the status, wealth, and treatment of business people. Throughout, the discussion indicates how much (and how little) business has changed, provides a clear picture of what business actually is, presents a model for understanding the social impact of business as a whole, and yields stimulating insights for public policy today.","Business,Economics",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1347934293l/11553889.jpg,231153260,https://goodreads.com/book/show/11553889-the-origins-of-business-money-and-markets,357,3.69,7,"The Origins of Business, Money and Markets (Columbia Business School Publishing)",16
John Meade Falkner,"""Moonfleet"" (1898) begins as a mystery and an adventure story, a tale of smuggling set among the cliffs, caves, and downs of Dorset. What will be the outcome of the conflict between smugglers and revenue men? How can the hero, John Trenchard, discover the secret of Colonel John Mohune's treasure? ,As the book progresses these two interwoven themes resolve themselves into a third and richer one, with the friendship and suffering of both John Trenchard and the craggy, taciturn Elzevir Block. Falkner's feeling for history and for the landscape of his Dorset setting combine with his gift for storytelling to turn Moonfleet into a historical romance of moving intensity.","Classics,Fiction,Adventure,Historical,Historical Fiction,Historical,Childrens,Literature,Literature,19th Century,European Literature,British Literature,Mystery",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1432828165l/115538._SY475_.jpg,014062144X,https://goodreads.com/book/show/115538.Moonfleet,248,3.94,385,Moonfleet,5014

Caroline Moorehead,"They were teachers, students, chemists, writers, and housewives; a singer at the Paris Opera, a midwife, a dental surgeon. They distributed anti-Nazi leaflets, printed subversive newspapers, hid resisters, secreted Jews to safety, transported weapons, and conveyed clandestine messages. The youngest was a schoolgirl of fifteen who scrawled ""V"" for victory on the walls of her lycée; the eldest, a farmer's wife in her sixties who harbored escaped Allied airmen. Strangers to each other, hailing from villages and cities from across France, these brave women were united in hatred and defiance of their Nazi occupiers.,Eventually, the Gestapo hunted down 230 of these women and imprisoned them in a fort outside Paris. Separated from home and loved ones, these disparate individuals turned to one another, their common experience conquering divisions of age, education, profession, and class, as they found solace and strength in their deep affection and camaraderie.,In January 1943, they were sent to their final destination: Auschwitz. Only forty-nine would return to France.,A Train in Winter, draws on interviews with these women and their families; German, French, and Polish archives; and documents held by World War II resistance organizations to uncover a dark chapter of history that offers an inspiring portrait of ordinary people, of bravery and survival—and of the remarkable, enduring power of female friendship.","Nonfiction,History,War,World War II,World War II,Holocaust,Cultural,France,War,Historical,Biography,Womens,Autobiography,Memoir",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1352667799l/11556268.jpg,61650706,https://goodreads.com/book/show/11556268-a-train-in-winter,374,3.84,1318,"A Train in Winter: An Extraordinary Story of Women, Friendship, and Resistance in Occupied France",7391

Erica Rand,"She’s skinny, white, and blond. She’s Barbie—an icon of femininity to generations of American girls. She’s also multiethnic and straight—or so says Mattel, Barbie’s manufacturer. But, as ,Barbie’s Queer Accessories ,demonstrates, many girls do things with Barbie never seen in any commercial. Erica Rand looks at the corporate marketing strategies used to create Barbie’s versatile (She’s a rapper! She’s an astronaut! She’s a bride!) but nonetheless premolded and still predominantly white image. Rand weighs the values Mattel seeks to embody in Barbie—evident, for example, in her improbably thin waist and her heterosexual partner—against the naked, dyked out, transgendered, and trashed versions favored by many juvenile owners and adult collectors of the doll.,Rand begins by focusing on the production and marketing of Barbie, starting in 1959, including Mattel’s numerous tie-ins and spin-offs. These variations, which include the much-promoted multiethnic Barbies and the controversial Earring Magic Ken, helped make the doll one of the most profitable toys on the market. In lively chapters based on extensive interviews, the author discusses adult testimony from both Barbie ""survivors"" and enthusiasts and explores how memories of the doll fit into women’s lives. Finally, Rand looks at cultural reappropriations of Barbie by artists, collectors, and especially lesbians and gay men, and considers resistance to Barbie as a form of social and political activism.,Illustrated with photographs of various interpretations and alterations of Barbie, this book encompasses both Barbie glorification and abjection as it testifies to the irrefutably compelling qualities of this bestselling toy. Anyone who has played with Barbie—or, more importantly, thought or worried about playing with Barbie—will find this book fascinating.","GLBT,Queer,Culture,Cultural Studies,Gender,Feminism,Sociology,Gender and Sexuality,Philosophy,Philosophy,Theory,Nonfiction",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348474600l/1155663.jpg,082231620X,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1155663.Barbie_s_Queer_Accessories,224,4.19,3,Barbie's Queer Accessories,54
Bernard Rudofsky,"In this book, Bernard Rudofsky steps outside the narrowly defined discipline that has governed our sense of architectural history and discusses the art of building as a universal phenomenon. He introduces the reader to communal architecture--architecture produced not by specialists but by the spontaneous and continuing activity of a whole people with a common heritage, acting within a community experience. A prehistoric theater district for a hundred thousand spectators on the American continent and underground towns and villages (complete with schools, offices, and factories) inhabited by millions of people are among the unexpected phenomena he brings to light.,The beauty of primitive architecture has often been dismissed as accidental, but today we recognize in it an art form that has resulted from human intelligence applied to uniquely human modes of life. Indeed, Rudofsky sees the philosophy and practical knowledge of the untutored builders as untapped sources of inspiration for industrial man trapped in his chaotic cities.","Architecture,Nonfiction,Design,Art,History,Anthropology,Cultural,Biology,Ecology,Philosophy,Theory,Urban",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1347228349l/115567.jpg,826310044,https://goodreads.com/book/show/115567.Architecture_Without_Architects,157,4.21,22,Architecture Without Architects: A Short Introduction to Non-Pedigreed Architecture,582

Esther Charlesworth,"From the targeted demolition of Mostar's Stari-Most Bridge in 1993 to the physical and social havoc caused by the 2004 Boxing Day Tsunami, the history of cities is often a history of destruction and reconstruction. But what political and aesthetic criteria should guide us in the rebuilding of cities devastated by war and natural calamities? The title of this timely and inspiring new book, Architects Without Frontiers, points to the potential for architects to play important roles in post-war relief and reconstruction. By working ""sans fronti�res"", Charlesworth suggests that architects and design professionals have a significant opportunity to assist peace-making and reconstruction efforts in the period immediately after conflict or disaster, when much of the housing, hospital, educational, transport, civic and business infrastructure has been destroyed or badly damaged. Through selected case studies, Charlesworth examines the role of architects, planners, urban designers and landscape architects in three cities following conflict - Beirut, Nicosia and Mostar - three cities where the mental and physical scars of violent conflict still remain. This book expands the traditional role of the architect from 'hero' to 'peacemaker' and discusses how design educators can stretch their wings to encompass the proliferating agendas and sites of civil unrest.",Architecture,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348837461l/115569.jpg,750668407,https://goodreads.com/book/show/115569.Architects_Without_Frontiers,175,4.33,1,Architects Without Frontiers,9

Daniel R. Headrick,"Although the Information Age is often described as a new era, a cultural leap springing directly from the invention of modern computers, it is simply the latest step in a long cultural process. Its conceptual roots stretch back to the profound changes that occurred during the Age of Reason and Revolution. ,When Information Came of Age, argues that the key to the present era lies in understanding the systems developed in the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries to gather, store, transform, display, and communicate information.,The book provides a concise and readable survey of the many conceptual developments between 1700 and 1850 and draws connections to leading technologies of today. It documents three breakthroughs in information systems that date to the period: the classification and nomenclature of Linnaeus, the chemical system devised by Lavoisier, and the metric system. It shows how eighteenth-century political arithmeticians and demographers pioneered statistics and graphs as a means for presenting data succinctly and visually. It describes the transformation of cartography from art to science as it incorporated new methods for determining longitude at sea and new data on the measure the arc of the meridian on land. Finally, it looks at the early steps in codifying and transmitting information, including the development of dictionaries, the invention of semaphore telegraphs and naval flag signaling, and the conceptual changes in the use and purpose of postal services.,When Information Came of Age, shows that like the roots of democracy and industrialization, the foundations of the Information Age were built in the eighteenth and early nineteenth century.","History,Nonfiction,Science,History Of Science,Science",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348047966l/1155709.jpg,195153731,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1155709.When_Information_Came_of_Age,260,3.11,3,"When Information Came of Age: Technologies of Knowledge in the Age of Reason and Revolution, 1700-1850",37

Paulo Drinot,"In ,The Allure of Labor,, Paulo Drinot rethinks the social politics of early-twentieth-century Peru. Arguing that industrialization was as much a cultural project as an economic one, he describes how intellectuals and policymakers came to believe that industrialization and a modern workforce would transform Peru into a civilized nation. Preoccupied with industrial progress but wary of the disruptive power of organized labor, these elites led the Peruvian state into new areas of regulation and social intervention designed to protect and improve the modern, efficient worker, whom they understood to be white or mestizo. Their thinking was shaped by racialized assumptions about work and workers inherited from the colonial era and inflected through scientific racism and positivism.Although the vast majority of laboring peoples in Peru were indigenous, in the minds of social reformers indigeneity was not commensurable with labor: Indians could not be workers and were therefore excluded from the labor policies enacted in the 1920s and 1930s and, more generally, from elite conceptions of industrial progress. Drinot shows how the incommensurability of indigeneity with labor was expressed in the 1920 constitution, in specific labor policies, and in the activities of state agencies created to oversee collective bargaining and provide workers with affordable housing, inexpensive food, and social insurance. He argues that the racialized assumptions of the modernizing Peruvian state are reflected in the enduring inequalities of present-day Peru.","History,Anthropology",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1328807612l/11557386.jpg,822350130,https://goodreads.com/book/show/11557386-the-allure-of-labor,328,4,0,"The Allure of Labor: Workers, Race, and the Making of the Peruvian State",11

Robert F. Hull Jr.,"This volume tells the story of the New Testament text from the earliest copies to the latest scholarly editions in Greek. Using a cross-sectional approach, the author introduces those who have developed the discipline of New Testament textual criticism (the movers); the ancient sources for recovering the text (the materials); the aims that drove them (the motives); the criteria and techniques (methods); and the books and other examples of best practices (the models) of New Testament textual criticism. Written primarily for seminary students, the book will also interest clergy and graduate students in biblical studies, theology, church history, and religion.","Christianity,New Testament",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348313096l/11557884.jpg,1589835204,https://goodreads.com/book/show/11557884-the-story-of-the-new-testament-text,244,3.95,3,"The Story of the New Testament Text: Movers, Materials, Motives, Methods, and Models",19

"Aristotle,Stephen Halliwell,Dionysius Cassius Longinus,Demetrius","This volume brings together the three most influential ancient Greek treatises on literature. Aristotle's ,Poetics, contains his treatment of Greek tragedy: its history, nature, and conventions, with details on poetic diction. Stephen Halliwell makes this seminal work newly accessible with a reliable text and a translation that is both accurate and readable. His authoritative introduction traces the work's debt to earlier theorists (especially Plato), its distinctive argument, and the reasons behind its enduring relevance. The essay ,On the Sublime,, usually attributed to ""Longinus"" (identity uncertain), was probably composed in the first century CE; its subject is the appreciation of greatness (""the sublime"") in writing, with analysis of illustrative passages ranging from Homer and Sappho to Plato. In this edition, Donald A. Russell has revised and newly annotated the text and translation by W. Hamilton Fyfe, and supplied a new introduction. The treatise ,On Style,, ascribed to an (again unidentifiable) ""Demetrius,"" was perhaps composed during the secod century BCE. It is notable particularly for its theory and analysis of four distinct styles (grand, elegant, plain, and forceful). Doreen Innes's fresh rendering of the work is based on the earlier Loeb translation by W. Rhys Roberts. Her new introduction and notes represent the latest scholarship.","Philosophy,Classics,Nonfiction,Unfinished,Poetry,Humanities,Classical Studies,Literature,History",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348377854l/115579.jpg,674995635,https://goodreads.com/book/show/115579.Aristotle,544,4.22,11,Aristotle: Poetics.

Sohrab Sobhani,"The Pragmatic Entente, is the first comprehensive work on the long standing yet ever changing relationship between Israel and Iran. Sohrab Sobhani draws on the experience and first hand accounts of those individuals involved in Israeli-Iranian relations before and after the 1979 arrival of Khomeini in Tehran. He studies this relationship against the complex background of Middle East politics. Sobhani interviews many former Iranian officials and reveals much new information explaining why Iran and Israel act the way they do and why their interests have converged over the last forty years. The book traces the principle trends in the emergence of the relationship between the two countries and identifies the main factors leading to both continuity and change in their relations. Organized in chronological order, The Pragmatic Entente concludes with a discussion of future Israeli-Iranian relations, examining the reasons why the Tehran-Tel Aviv axis will continue to be an enduring feature of the Middle Eastern power configuration.,The book begins with a discussion of the origins of Israeli-Iranian relations which existed at first in order to aid Iraqi Jews in relocation to Israel. Sobhani goes on to discuss how Iran's religious right used the issue of Israel's recognition by Iran as a political weapon against the central government. Further chapters examine in depth: the Israeli-Iranian alliance against radical Arab states; support of Kurdish rebels inside Iraq; the implications of the 1973 Yom Kippur War; British withdrawal from the Persian Gulf; an Israeli-Iranian plan to develop missiles capable of carrying nuclear warheads. Policymakers as well as students and scholars of Middle Eastern politics will find ,The Pragmatic Entente, stimulating reading.","Cultural,Iran",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1181457167l/1155804.jpg,275933377,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1155804.The_Pragmatic_Entente,0,3.5,0,"The Pragmatic Entente: Israeli-Iranian Relations, 1948-1988",2
Anne Zouroudi,"It is winter in the mountains of Greece and as the snow falls in the tiny village of Vrisi a coffin is unearthed and broken open, revealing some unexpected remains to the astonished mourners gathered at the graveside. In a village where gossip flows like ouzo, the discovery in the grave sets tongues wagging and heads shaking. But when a body is found buried beneath the fallen snow in the shadow of the shrine of St Fanourios (the patron saint of lost things), it seems the truth, behind both the body and the coffin may be far stranger than the villagers' wildest imaginings. Hermes Diaktoros, drawn to the mountains on an affair of the heart, finds himself embroiled in the mysteries of Vrisi, as well as the enigmatic last will and testament of Greece's most admired modern poet.

Laura A. Ring,"Ethnic violence is a widespread concern, but we know very little about the micro-mechanics of coexistence in the neighborhoods around the world where inter-group peace is maintained amidst civic strife. In this ethnographic study of a multi-ethnic, middle-class high-rise apartment building in Karachi, Pakistan, Laura A. Ring argues that peace is the product of a relentless daily labor, much of it carried out in the zenana, or women's space. Everyday rhythms of life in the building are shaped by gender, ethnic and rural/urban tensions, national culture, and competing interpretations of Islam. Women's exchanges between households--visiting, borrowing, helping--and management of male anger are forms of creative labor that regulate and make sense of ethnic differences. Linking psychological senses of ""tension"" with anthropological views of the social significance of exchange, Ring argues that social-cultural tension is not so much resolved as borne and sustained by women's practices. Framed by a vivid and highly personal narrative of the author's interactions with her neighbors, her Pakistani in-laws, and other residents of the city, Zenana provides a rare glimpse into contemporary urban life in a Muslim society.","Nonfiction,Academic,School,Anthropology,Anthropology,Ethnography",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1383166998l/1155807.jpg,253218845,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1155807.Zenana,224,3.65,6,Zenana: Everyday Peace in a Karachi Apartment Building,60

"Doug Porter,Gary Smith","If you are interested in Coaching the System, you must be either desperate or crazy!"" At least that's what people told authors Gary Smith and Doug Porter when they began investigating this revolutionary style of play almost a decade ago. Ignoring the critics, they went on to coach the two highest scoring teams in men's and women's college basketball history: the University of Redlands, California (132.4 ppg), and Olivet Nazarene University in Illinois (104.1 ppg). From its origins as the Sonny Allen Numbered Fast Break, to Paul Westhead's Loyola Marymount up-tempo game, the System has been around for decades. But when Grinnell College's David Arseneault added platoon substitution patterns and hockey-style short shifts, placing a priority on creating three-point looks for his ""preferred shooters,"" the System truly came into its own. Smith and Porter learned the Grinnell version of the System from Arseneault himself, adapting it to fit their situations coaching men's and women's programs. In the past decade their teams set 32 NCAA and NAIA records between them, including most 100-point games in a season (Redlands-23; Olivet-24). Olivet also holds national records for defensive turnovers (36.3 per game) assists (23.8 per game), and three pointers made in a season (509, 15.6 per game). Redlands owns college basketball records (all levels) for field goal attempts (110.3 per game), and three-pointers made (23.8 per game). Now you can learn every detail of this devastating full court run-and-press attack that allows you to dictate tempo and force your opponents out of their normal game plan, capturing the imagination of your players and community, and making coaching fun again! You'll learn exactly how and why the System works, how to adapt it to fit your personnel, suggestions for conditioning players, organizing System practices, and even ways to respond to the inevitable criticisms that come with playing the game this far ""outside the box."" Other chapters offer complete descriptions of the Redlands Attack (Coach Smith's variation of the Grinnell offense), the LMU Attack (which Westhead popularized and used to advance to the NCAA regional finals in 1990), and the Olivet Attack (Coach Porter's hybrid version of the LMU and Dribble-Drive offenses). Finally, you'll learn System defensive principles, terminology, and how to cover every conceivable press attack and press-breaker alignment. Also included are 57 drills and over 300 diagrams to illustrate System offense and defense, providing you with a complete blueprint for ""Coaching the System!","Sports,Basketball",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1347578434l/11558124.jpg,146113157X,https://goodreads.com/book/show/11558124-coaching-the-system,412,4.46,1,Coaching the System: A Complete Guide to Basketball's Most Explosive Style of Play,13

Robert Conroy,"Only days after Normandy, Hitler is taken out of the equation and Heinrich Himmler, brutal head of the SS, assumes control of the Reich.  On the Allied side, there is confusion.  Should attempts be made to negotiate with the new government or should unconditional surrender still be the only option?  With the specter of a German super-weapon moving closer to completion and the German generals finally allowed to fight the kind of war at which they are masters, the allies are pushed toward a course of accommodation or even defeat.  Will the soldiers of the Grand Alliance find the courage and conviction to fight on in the face of such daunting odds?  And can alliance leaders put into place a new plan in time to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat by the German war machine?  A new and terrible battle for a free world is on.","Science Fiction,Alternate History,Fiction,Historical,Historical Fiction,Science Fiction,War,War,Military Fiction,War,World War II,Adventure,Science Fiction Fantasy",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1327884898l/11559030.jpg,1451637616,https://goodreads.com/book/show/11559030-himmler-s-war,368,3.66,80,Himmler's War,683
Cristina Alger,"
  ,
    , A sophisticated page-turner about a wealthy New York family embroiled in a financial scandal with cataclysmic consequences. ,
  ,
  ,Now that he's married to Merrill Darling, daughter of billionaire financier Carter Darling, attorney Paul Ross has grown accustomed to New York society and all of its luxuries: a Park Avenue apartment, weekends in the Hamptons, bespoke suits. When Paul loses his job, Carter offers him the chance to head the legal team at his hedge fund. Thrilled with his good fortune in the midst of the worst financial downturn since the Great Depression, Paul accepts the position.,
  ,But Paul's luck is about to shift: a tragic event catapults the Darling family into the media spotlight, a regulatory investigation, and a red-hot scandal with enormous implications for everyone involved. Suddenly, Paul must decide where his loyalties lie-will he save himself while betraying his wife and in-laws or protect the family business at all costs?,
  ,Cristina Alger's glittering debut novel interweaves the narratives of the Darling family, two eager SEC attorneys, and a team of journalists all racing to uncover-or cover up-the truth. With echoes of a fictional ,Too Big to Fail, and the novels of Dominick Dunne, ,The Darlings, offers an irresistible glimpse into the highest echelons of New York society-a world seldom seen by outsiders-and a fast-paced thriller of epic proportions.,

Gene R. Cook,"We all need help from the Lord in every area of our lives, and one vital key to receiving that help is prayer. In Receiving Answers to Our Prayers, Elder Cook examines some of the most important principles and practices of prayer, which the Lord has taught us through scripture and through living prophets. By illustrating those principles through examples and many true-life stories, he shows that the Lord does answer prayers and suggests ways we can become more receptive to the answers the Lord sends.

"Adam Smith,Andrew S. Skinner","Originally delivered in the form of lectures at Glasgow, Adam Smith's The Wealth of Nations Books I-III laid the foundations of economic theory in general and 'classical' economics in particular, and this Penguin Classics edition is edited with an introduction and notes by Andrew Skinner.,The publication of ,The Wealth of Nations, in 1776 coincided with America's Declaration of Independence, and with this landmark treatise on political economy, Adam Smith paved the way for modern capitalism, arguing that a truly free market - fired by competition yet guided as if by an 'invisible hand' to ensure justice and equality - was the engine of a fair and productive society. Books I - III of ,The Wealth of Nations, examine the 'division of labour' as the key to economic growth, by ensuring the interdependence of individuals within society. They also cover the origins of money and the importance of wages, profit, rent and stocks; but the real sophistication of his analysis derives from the fact that it encompasses a combination of ethics, philosophy and history to create a vast panorama of society.,This edition contains an analytical introduction offering an in-depth discussion of Smith as an economist and social scientist, as well as a preface, further reading and explanatory notes.","Economics,Philosophy,Nonfiction,Classics,Business,Politics,History,Economics,Finance,Social Science,Politics,Political Science",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1429470663l/115596.jpg,140432086,https://goodreads.com/book/show/115596.The_Wealth_of_Nations_Books_1_3,544,3.96,78,"The Wealth of Nations, Books 1-3",1038

"Samuel Bowles,Herbert Gintis","Why do humans, uniquely among animals, cooperate in large numbers to advance projects for the common good? Contrary to the conventional wisdom in biology and economics, this generous and civic-minded behavior is widespread and cannot be explained simply by far-sighted self-interest or a desire to help close genealogical kin., ,In ,A Cooperative Species,, Samuel Bowles and Herbert Gintis--pioneers in the new experimental and evolutionary science of human behavior--show that the central issue is not why selfish people act generously, but instead how genetic and cultural evolution has produced a species in which substantial numbers make sacrifices to uphold ethical norms and to help even total strangers., ,The authors describe how, for thousands of generations, cooperation with fellow group members has been essential to survival. Groups that created institutions to protect the civic-minded from exploitation by the selfish flourished and prevailed in conflicts with less cooperative groups. Key to this process was the evolution of social emotions such as shame and guilt, and our capacity to internalize social norms so that acting ethically became a personal goal rather than simply a prudent way to avoid punishment., ,Using experimental, archaeological, genetic, and ethnographic data to calibrate models of the coevolution of genes and culture as well as prehistoric warfare and other forms of group competition, ,A Cooperative Species, provides a compelling and novel account of how humans came to be moral and cooperative.","Economics,Psychology,Science,Sociology,Anthropology,Biology,Evolution,Philosophy,Nonfiction,History,Science,Biology",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1328342565l/11559910.jpg,,https://goodreads.com/book/show/11559910-a-cooperative-species,280,3.82,8,A Cooperative Species: Human Reciprocity and Its Evolution,84

His awesome investment record has made him a cult figure popularly known for his seeming contradictions: a billionaire who has a modest lifestyle, a phenomenally successful investor who eschews the revolving-door trading of modern Wall Street, a brilliant dealmaker who cultivates a homespun aura.,Journalist Roger Lowenstein draws on three years of unprecedented access to Buffett’s family, friends, and colleagues to provide the first definitive, inside account of the life and career of this American original.

Roger S. Gocking,"Gocking provides a historical overview of Ghana from the emergence of precolonial states through increasing contact with Europeans that led to the establishment of formal colonial rule by Great Britian at the end of the 19th century. Colonial rule transformed what was known as the Gold Coast economically, socially, and politically, but it contained the seeds of its own demise. After World War II an increasingly more effective nationalist movement challenged British rule, and in 1957 Ghana became independent. Independence brought its own challenges the most important of which was the inability to maintain political stability. Within the space of 24 years there were four military coups and the collapse of three republics. Ghana's Fourth Republic, established in 1993, has dealt with the legacy of instability inherited from the past as it moves towards a more stable future.,A timeline, photographs, maps, and an appendix of biographies of notable figures in the history of Ghana are included.

Jennifer Hasty,"In The Press and Political Culture in Ghana, Jennifer Hasty looks at the practices of journalism and newsmaking at privately owned and state-operated daily newspapers in Ghana. Hasty decodes the styles and uncovers the strategies that characterize Ghana's major printed news media, focusing on the differences between news generated by the state and news that comes from private sources. Not only are the angles radically different, but so are ways of gathering the news, assigning beats, using sources, and writing articles. For all its differences in presentation, however, Hasty shows that the news in Ghana projects a unified voice that is the result of a contentious and multifarious process that joins Ghanaians in global, national, and local debates. An important engagement with the production of news and news media, this book also explores questions about the relationship of popular culture to state politics, the expression of civic culture, and the role of the media in constituting national and cultural identities.",,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1356453308l/1156018.jpg,253217482,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1156018.The_Press_and_Political_Culture_in_Ghana,216,4.2,0,The Press and Political Culture in Ghana,5

For Béatrice Peltre, author of the award-winning blog LaTartineGourmande.com, to cook is to delight in the best of what life has to offer—the people and places we love. Welcome to a world where flavors are collected as souvenirs and shared as heirlooms, and where the dishes we create are expressions of our ,joie de vivre,. ,With nearly 100 recipes and charming anecdotes, ,La Tartine Gourmande, takes you on a journey, not only through the meals of the day but around the world, as Béa revisits her inspiration for each dish. Though her style is largely inspired by her native France, you’ll find a wide array of influences as she brings creative twists to classic recipes—all while remaining effortlessly healthful and balanced. The gluten-free recipes use whole grains like quinoa, millet, buckwheat, and nut flours, lending surprising depth of flavor and nutrients, even to desserts. You’ll taste the best of her adventures abroad from Denmark to New Zealand, her childhood in the French countryside, and the simple wholesomeness of her charmed life at home in Boston. ,Your mouth will water as Béa recalls the ,oeufs en cocotte, (“baked eggs”) that she ate as a child after collecting fresh eggs from her grandmother’s hen house. Her recipe for this classic dish now includes leeks, spinach, smoked salmon, and cumin. Or try the buttermilk, lemon, and poppyseed pancakes she made every morning in Crete when she was pregnant—they’re now her little daughter Lulu’s favorite. Warm up with a bowl of celeriac, white sweet potato, and apple soup, a dish inspired by a chilly day of horseback riding in New Zealand. You’ll love sharing the saffron-flavored crab and watercress soufflé, a delicious homage to one of her mother’s best-loved Christmas traditions. And since most would agree that “a meal without dessert is like wearing only one shoe,” try the apple, rhubarb, and strawberry nutty crumble, served with vanilla-flavored custard, just the way her husband’s Irish grandfather preferred. ,Lush styling and photography combined with sweet stories, foodie tidbits, and fresh and original recipes make ,La Tartine Gourmande, perfect for those who love food and the way our lives play around it.

McCaskie provides a nuanced study of this era 'from below, ' focusing on the everyday lives of commoners in Adeebeba, an independent village that was engulfed by the expansion of the city of Kumase in the 20th century. He tells this story through the words of the villagers themselves, drawing on life histories collected by the Ashanti Social Survey in the 1940s.,McCaskie provides a deep cultural reading that ranges over issues of selfhood and community and their impact on the colonial experience. His discussion touches on questions of identity, belief, power, money, rights, obligations, gender, sexuality, and much more.

Douglas Mawson,"Outside the bowl of chaos was brimming with drift-snow and, as I lay in the sleeping-bag beside my dead companion, I wondered how I would manage to break and pitch camp single-handed."" ~ Douglas Mawson,The Home of the Blizzard, is a tale of discovery and adventure in the Antarctic - of pioneering deeds, great courage, heart-stopping rescues and heroic perseverance. This classic book is also a detailed account of the Australasian Antarctic Expedition's daily subsistence on the icy continent, its scientific endeavours, and Douglas Mawson's epic sledge journey in 1912-13 during which his companions, Ninnis, and Mertz, both perished.,It is illustrated with over ninety original photographs depicting the wildlife, the harsh living conditions, and the spirit of the explorers.,Mawson's writings were first published, in two volumes, in 1915. An abridged popular edition was published in 1930. This facsimile edition of the abridged popular edition was first published in 1996.,Douglas Mawson was born in Yorkshire in 1882, and moved to Australia, with his family, in 1884. Throughout his life he made important contributions to many fields of science, including geology, forestry, and conservation.,Mawson is best remembered, though, as a pioneering explorer of the Antarctic region. His polar feats so excited public imagination that thousands of admirers once carried him down the main street of Adelaide.,He was knighted for his achievements in 1914, and his death, in 1958, was marked by a state funeral.","Nonfiction,History,Adventure,Adventure,Survival,Travel,Autobiography,Memoir,Biography,Historical,Biography,Autobiography,Science",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1181460115l/1156181._SY475_.jpg,1602391440,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1156181.The_Home_Of_The_Blizzard,484,4.1,44,The Home Of The Blizzard: A True Story Of Antarctic Survival,410

Sander L. Gilman,"The fat man—a cultural icon, a social enigma, a pressing medical issue—is the subject of this remarkably rich book. The figures that Sander L. Gilman considers, from the ugly fat man with the beautiful sylph trapped inside to the smart fat boy to the aging body desirous of rejuvenation, appear and reappear in different guises throughout Western culture. And as is often true, such marginal cases help define the shifting center of our dreams and beliefs. An exploration into the world of male body fantasies, Gilman’s book examines how the representation of the fat man alters with time and alters how men relate to their own bodies and the bodies of others, both male and female. His examples—ranging from Santa Claus to Sancho Panza, from Falstaff to Babe Ruth, from Nero Wolfe to Al Roker—illustrate the complexity perennially associated with fat men. From discourses about normality to the playing fields of baseball, from Greek male beauty to the fat detective, Gilman’s book examines and illuminates how cultures have imagined and portrayed the fat boy.","Fat,Fat Studies",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1328821843l/1156194.jpg,803221835,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1156194.Fat_Boys,310,3.7,1,Fat Boys: A Slim Book,10

"Yanis Varoufakis,Joseph Halevi,Nicholas J. Theocarakis","Once in a while the world astonishes itself. Anxious incredulity replaces intellectual torpor and a puzzled public strains its antennae in every possible direction, desperately seeking explanations for the causes and nature of what just hit it. 2008 was such a moment. Not only did the financial system collapse, and send the real economy into a tailspin, but it also revealed the great gulf separating economics from a very real capitalism. Modern Political Economics has a single aim: To help readers make sense of how 2008 came about and what the post-2008 world has in store. The book is divided into two parts. The first part delves into every major economic theory, from Aristotle to the present, with a determination to discover clues of what went wrong in 2008. The main finding is that all economic theory is inherently flawed. Any system of ideas whose purpose is to describe capitalism in mathematical or engineering terms leads to inevitable logical inconsistency; an inherent error that stands between us and a decent grasp of capitalist reality. The only scientific truth about capitalism is its radical indeterminacy, a condition which makes it impossible to use science's tools (e.g. calculus and statistics) to second-guess it. The second part casts an attentive eye on the post-war era; on the breeding ground of the Crash of 2008. It distinguishes between two major post-war phases: The Global Plan (1947-1971) and the Global Minotaur (1971-2008). This dynamic new book delves into every major economic theory and maps out meticulously the trajectory that global capitalism followed from post-war almost centrally planned stability, to designed disintegration in the 1970s, to an intentional magnification of unsustainable imbalances in the 1980s and, finally, to the most spectacular privatisation of money in the 1990s and beyond.

"Cathy O'Dowd,Ian Woodall","May 1996 was one of the most eventful months in Everest's history - for all the wrong reasons. Forteen expeditions were trying to climb the mountain from the southern side, among them the first South African team ever to attempt the summit. Sponsored initially by the ""Johannesburg Sunday Times"" and with the personal blessing of Nelson Mandela, the expedition was led by Ian Woodhall, and ex-British Army officer who had relatively limited high-altitude experience. The South Africans were dogged by early problems, which started when the three most experienced climbers in the team quit before even reaching base camp due to personality clashes with Woodhall, who also banished a reporter and photographer from the main sponsor, who then withdrew their support. At the South Col (26,000 feet) they sat out the huge storm of May 10-11 that led to the death of 11 climbers, but finally achieved their goal on Saturday 25 May when Ian Woodhill and Cathy O'Dowd reached the summit of Everest.

"Catherine M. Andronik,Joseph Daniel Fiedler","MEET HATSHEPSUT, ,PHAROAH OF EGYPT Here is an engaging and informative picture-book biography, lushly illustrated by award-winning artist Joseph Daniel Fiedler, of Egypt's only successful female pharaoh.,Hatshepsut gained Egypt's throne when all her male siblings -- including the half brother whom she married -- died. Originally named regent to her nephew, Tuthmosis III, Hatshepsut gradually assumed more and more power, and eventually had herself crowned pharaoh. Since no word existed for a female ruler, Hatshepsut used the male title. She also wore men's clothing and a beard, and referred to herself as ""he"" as well as ""she."",Hatshepsut's reign was a peaceful and prosperous one. She sent an expedition to explore Punt, an exotic land of riches, and built beautiful monuments, including a magnificent temple on which she had artists carve and paint scenes from her life and reign.,Following her death, Tuthmosis III tried to erase evidence of Hatshepsut's reign to make it seem as though he had succeeded his father directly. Catherine M. Andronik explains how, despite this vandalism, archaeologists have been able to piece together the story of this unconventional pharaoh's remarkable and mysterious life.","History,Nonfiction,Childrens,Picture Books,Northern Africa,Egypt,Biography,Historical,Childrens,Juvenile",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1387737269l/1156395.jpg,689825625,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1156395.Hatshepsut_His_Majesty_Herself,40,3.6,9,"Hatshepsut, His Majesty, Herself",58
Stephen King,"Before he gave us the “one of a kind classic” (The Wall Street Journal) memoir On Writing, Stephen King wrote a nonfiction masterpiece in Danse Macabre, “one of the best books on American popular culture” (Philadelphia Inquirer).,From the author of dozens of #1 New York Times bestsellers and the creator of many unforgettable movies comes a vivid, intelligent, and nostalgic journey through three decades of horror as experienced through the eyes of the most popular writer in the genre. In 1981, years before he sat down to tackle On Writing, Stephen King decided to address the topic of what makes horror horrifying and what makes terror terrifying. Here, in ten brilliantly written chapters, King delivers one colorful observation after another about the great stories, books, and films that comprise the horror genre—from Frankenstein and Dracula to The Exorcist, The Twilight Zone, and Earth vs. The Flying Saucers.,With the insight and good humor his fans appreciated in On Writing, Danse Macabre is an enjoyably entertaining tour through Stephen King’s beloved world of horror.","Horror,Nonfiction,Language,Writing,Writing,Essays,Reference,Writing,Books About Books,Criticism,Literary Criticism,Biography,History,Criticism",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1309287093l/11563.jpg,042518160X,https://goodreads.com/book/show/11563.Danse_Macabre,400,3.65,969,Danse Macabre,25552

Ugo Bardi,"The Limits to Growth (Meadows, 1972) generated unprecedented controversy with its predictions of the eventual collapse of the world's economies. First hailed as a great advance in science, The Limits to Growth was subsequently rejected and demonized. However, with many national economies now at risk and global peak oil apparently a reality, the methods, scenarios, and predictions of The Limits to Growth are in great need of reappraisal. In ""The"" ""Limits to Growth Revisited,"" Ugo Bardi examines both the science and the polemics surrounding this work, and in particular the reactions of economists that marginalized its methods and conclusions for more than 30 years. The Limits to Growth was a milestone in attempts to model the future of our society, and it is vital today for both scientists and policy makers to understand its scientific basis, current relevance, and the social and political mechanisms that led to its rejection. Bardi also addresses the all-important question of whether the methods and approaches of The Limits to Growth can contribute to an understanding of what happened to the global economy in the Great Recession and where we are headed from there.""","Science,Environment,Economics,Nonfiction,History,Environment,Sustainability",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1344720442l/11566421.jpg,1441994157,https://goodreads.com/book/show/11566421-the-limits-to-growth-revisited,119,4.31,3,The Limits To Growth Revisited (Springer Briefs In Energy / Energy Analysis),13

We have thousands of titles available, and we invite you to search for us by name, contact us via our website, or download our most recent catalogues. Those who have not ""tasted magical superstitions"" may here find them ready to their hand. ""In brief, in this book are kept the principles of magical conveyances."" It may be conceded at once that the undertaking is scrupulously fulfilled; what the operator must do and how he should perform it, so as to ""draw spirits into discourse,"" are matters set forth so plainly that the wayfaring man need not err therein. Assuming the sacerdotal office of the operator, or a priest for an accomplice, it is all so simple that failure could not well be ascribed to a blunder on his part. The procedure is divided into two parts--a general method for the evocation of the Spirits of the Air, who are undoubtedly demons, and a set of angelical conjurations proper to each day of the week. The second section presumably belongs to the department of White Magic, as the intelligences concerned are said to be good and great, though their offices are mixed and confusing, including the discovery of treasures, the detection of secrets, fomenting war, opening locks and bolts, procuring the love of women, inclining men to luxury and sowing hatred and evil thought. Obviously, White Magic of this kind is much blacker than it is painted.","Occult,Religion,Esoterica",,1926842359,https://goodreads.com/book/show/11566933-heptameron,54,3.36,3,Heptameron,22
Alison Bechdel,"A graphic memoir of Alison Bechdel becoming the artist her mother wanted to be.,Alison Bechdel’s ,Fun Home, was a pop culture and literary phenomenon. Now, a second thrilling tale of filial sleuthery, this time about her mother: voracious reader, music lover, passionate amateur actor. Also a woman, unhappily married to a closeted gay man, whose artistic aspirations simmered under the surface of Bechdel's childhood . . . and who stopped touching or kissing her daughter good night, forever, when she was seven. Poignantly, hilariously, Bechdel embarks on a quest for answers concerning the mother-daughter gulf. It's a richly layered search that leads readers from the fascinating life and work of the iconic twentieth-century psychoanalyst Donald Winnicott, to one explosively illuminating Dr. Seuss illustration, to Bechdel’s own (serially monogamous) adult love life. And, finally, back to Mother—to a truce, fragile and real-time, that will move and astonish all adult children of gifted mothers.","Sequential Art,Graphic Novels,Autobiography,Memoir,Sequential Art,Comics,Nonfiction,LGBT,GLBT,Queer,Biography,Graphic Novels Comics,Psychology,Biography Memoir",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1511409644l/11566956._SX318_.jpg,618982507,https://goodreads.com/book/show/11566956-are-you-my-mother-a-comic-drama,290,3.69,3334,Are You My Mother?

Michael LaBossiere,"A fallacy is an error in reasoning. That is, it is a piece of bad logic. Just as it is a good idea to avoid eating bad food, it is also a rather good idea to avoid bad reasoning. Unfortunately, bad reasoning is all too common—it pours out of the television and infests the web like an army of venomous spiders. Perhaps even worse than the fallacies inflicted from the outside are self-inflicted fallacies. These can lead people to make poor decisions about matters great and small.,Fortunately, there is a defense against bad reasoning, namely knowledge. This concise book provides the reader with definitions and examples of forty-two common fallacies—the knowledge a person needs to defend herself in a world awash in fallacies. This short book is not intended to be a handbook on winning arguments or a text on general logic.,The book contains the following fallacies:,Ad Hominem,Ad Hominem Tu Quoque,Appeal to the Consequences of a Belief,Appeal to Authority,Appeal to Belief,Appeal to Common Practice,Appeal to Emotion,Appeal to Popularity,Appeal to Fear,Appeal to Flattery,Appeal to Novelty,Appeal to Pity,Appeal to Popularity,Appeal to Ridicule,Appeal to Spite,Appeal to Tradition,Begging the Question,Biased Generalization,Burden of Proof,Circumstantial Ad Hominem,Fallacy of Composition,Confusing Cause and Effect,Fallacy of Division,False Dilemma,Gambler’s Fallacy,Genetic Fallacy,Guilt by Association,Hasty Generalization,Ignoring a Common Cause,Middle Ground,Misleading Vividness,Peer Pressure,Personal Attack,Poisoning the Well,Post Hoc,Questionable Cause,Red Herring,Relativist Fallacy,Slippery Slope,Special Pleading,Spotlight,Straw Man,Two Wrongs Make a Right,Two Wrongs Make a Right","Philosophy,Nonfiction,Philosophy,Logic,Psychology,Self Help,Personal Development",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1356100139l/11566973.jpg,,https://goodreads.com/book/show/11566973-42-fallacies,59,3.65,23,42 Fallacies,380

Neill Lochery,"Lisbon had a pivotal role in the history of World War II, though not a gun was fired there. The only European city in which both the Allies and the Axis power operated openly, it was temporary home to much of Europe’s exiled royalty, over one million refugees seeking passage to the U.S., and a host of spies, secret police, captains of industry, bankers, prominent Jews, writers and artists, escaped POWs, and black marketeers. An operations officer writing in 1944 described the daily scene at Lisbon’s airport as being like the movie ,Casablanca,, times twenty. In this riveting narrative, renowned historian Neill Lochery draws on his relationships with high-level Portuguese contacts, access to records recently uncovered from Portuguese secret police and banking archives, and other unpublished documents to offer a revelatory portrait of the War’s back stage. And he tells the story of how Portugal, a relatively poor European country trying frantically to remain neutral amidst extraordinary pressures, survived the war not only physically intact but significantly wealthier. The country’s emergence as a prosperous European Union nation would be financed in part, it turns out, by a cache of Nazi gold.","History,Nonfiction,Cultural,Portugal,War,World War II,War,Politics,History,European History,Spy Thriller,Espionage,Literature,20th Century,Military,Military History",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1328757730l/11567065.jpg,1586488791,https://goodreads.com/book/show/11567065-lisbon,306,3.57,115,"Lisbon: War in the Shadows of the City of Light, 1939-1945",625

S.D. Goitein,"This six-volume ""portrait of a Mediterranean personality"" is a composite portrait of the individuals who wrote the personal letters, contracts, and all other manuscript fragments that found their way into the Cairo Geniza. Most of the fragments from the Geniza, a storeroom for discarded writings that could not be thrown away because they might contain the name of God, had been removed to Cambridge University Library and other libraries around the world. Professor Goitein devoted the last thirty years of his long and productive life to their study, deciphering the language of the documents and organizing what he called a ""marvelous treasure trove of manuscripts"" into a coherent, fascinating picture of the society that created them.,It is a rich, panoramic view of how people lived, traveled, worshiped, and conducted their economic and social affairs. The first and second volumes describe the economic foundations of the society and the institutions and social and political structures that characterized the community. The remaining material, intended for a single volume describing the particulars of the way people lived, blossomed into three volumes, devoted respectively to the family, daily life, and the individual. The divisions are arbitrary but helpful because of the wealth of information. The author refers throughout to other passages in his monumental work that amplify what is discussed in any particular section. The result is an incomparably clear and immediate impression of how it was in the Mediterranean world of the tenth through the thirteenth century.,Volume V, subtitled ,The Individual,, draws a portrait of the individual—a social person who mingled within the community; addressed the challenges of poverty, illness, aging, and death; possessed friends, enemies, and lovers; prayed and responded within a religious community; learned, created, thought and taught.","Judaism,Judaica",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1347588923l/1156731.jpg,520221621,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1156731.A_Mediterranean_Society_Volume_V,687,5,0,"A Mediterranean Society, Volume V: The Jewish Communities of the Arab World as Portrayed in the Documents of the Cairo Geniza, The Individual",4

Leo Tolstoy,"War and Peace is a novel by the Russian author Leo Tolstoy. It is regarded as one of the central works of world literature. War and Peace and Tolstoy's other major prose work, Anna Karenina (1873–77), are considered Tolstoy's finest literary achievements.,The novel charts the history of the French invasion of Russia, and the impact of the Napoleonic era on Tsarist society, through the stories of five Russian aristocratic families. Portions of an earlier version, titled The Year 1805, were serialized in The Russian Messenger between 1865 and 1867. The novel was first published in its entirety in 1869. Newsweek in 2009 ranked it first in its Top 100 Books. In 2007, Time magazine ranked War and Peace third in its poll of the 10 greatest books of all time while Anna Karenina was ranked first.,Tolstoy himself said that War and Peace was ""not a novel, even less is it a poem, and still less a historical chronicle"". Large sections, especially in the later chapters, are philosophical discussion rather than narrative. He also said that the best Russian literature does not conform to standards and hence hesitated to call War and Peace a novel. Instead, he regarded Anna Karenina as his first true novel. According to the Encyclopædia Britannica, ""no single English novel attains the universality of Leo Tolstoy's War and Peace.""","Short Stories,Literature,Russian Literature,Cultural,Russia,Classics",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1327843171l/11568509.jpg,,https://goodreads.com/book/show/11568509-work-death-and-sickness,108,3.6,2,"Work, Death and Sickness",52

Robert C. Allen,"Why are some countries rich and others poor? In 1500, global income differences were small, but disparities have grown dramatically since Columbus reached America. In this Very Short Introduction, Robert C. Allen shows how the interplay of geography, globalization, technological change, and economic policy has determined the wealth and poverty of nations. Allen shows how the industrial revolution was Britain's path-breaking response to the challenge of globalization. Western Europe and North America joined Britain to form a club of rich nations, pursuing four polices--creating a national market by abolishing internal tariffs and investing in transportation, erecting an external tariff to protect their fledgling industries from British competition, creating banks to stabilize the currency and mobilize domestic savings for investment, and promoting mass education to prepare people for industrial work. Together these countries pioneered new technologies that have made them ever richer. A few countries--Japan, Soviet Russia, South Korea, Taiwan, and perhaps China--have caught up with the West through creative responses to the technological challenge and with Big Push industrialization that has achieved rapid growth through coordinated investment.","Economics,History,Nonfiction,Politics,Business,History,World History,Social Science,Literature,21st Century,Science,Economics,Finance",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348566669l/11569567.jpg,199596654,https://goodreads.com/book/show/11569567-global-economic-history,196,3.84,111,Global Economic History: A Very Short Introduction,842

Schrödinger's world view, derived from the Indian writings of the Vedanta, is that there is only a single consciousness of which we are all different aspects. He admits that this view is mystical and metaphysical and incapable of logical deduction. But he also insists that this is true of the belief in an external world capable of influencing the mind and of being influenced by it.

Jag vill visa vad jag egentligen menade, om jag hade kunnat. Ett sätt att be mig själv om ursäkt. Det är även en del ilska över att man förväntas vara på ett visst sätt för att man är kvinna, man, barn, gammal och så vidare. Och en frustation över att vi människor prioriterar fel så ofta och inte säger vad vi egentligen menar. Jag tycker inte illa om att leva, men jag tycker att det är svårt.

"C. Warren Hollister,Amanda Clark Frost","Henry I, son of William the Conqueror, ruled from 1100 to 1135, a time of fundamental change in the Anglo-Norman world. This long-awaited biography, written by one of the most distinguished medievalists of his generation, offers a major reassessment of Henry’s character and reign. Challenging the dark and dated portrait of the king as brutal, greedy, and repressive, it argues instead that Henry’s rule was based on reason and order. ,C. Warren Hollister points out that Henry laid the foundations for judicial and financial institutions usually attributed to his grandson, Henry II. Royal government was centralized and systematized, leading to firm, stable, and peaceful rule for his subjects in both England and Normandy. By mid-reign Henry I was the most powerful king in Western Europe, and with astute diplomacy, an intelligence network, and strategic marriages of his children (legitimate and illegitimate), he was able to undermine the various coalitions mounted against him. Henry strove throughout his reign to solidify the Anglo-Norman dynasty, and his marriage linked the Normans to the Old English line.,Hollister vividly describes Henry’s life and reign, places them against the political background of the time, and provides analytical studies of the king and his magnates, the royal administration, and relations between king and church. The resulting volume is one that will be welcomed by students and general readers alike.","History,Biography,Nonfiction,History,Medieval History,European Literature,British Literature,Historical,Medieval",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1356441710l/1157154.jpg,300098294,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1157154.Henry_I,588,4.15,20,Henry I,95
James A. Connor,"In a major biography of Blaise Pascal, James Connor explores both the intellectual giant whose theory of probability paved the way for modernity and the devout religious mystic who dared apply probability to faith. A child prodigy, Pascal made essential additions to Descartes's work at age sixteen. By age nineteen, he had invented the world's first mechanical calculator. But despite his immense contributions to modern science and mathematical thinking, it is Pascal's wager with God that set him apart from his peers as a man fully engaged with both religious and scientific pursuits.,One night in 1654, Pascal had a visit from God, a mystical experience that changed his life. Struggling to explain God's existence to others, Pascal dared to apply his mathematical work to religious faith, playing dice with divinity: he argued for the existence of God, basing his position not on rigorous logical principles as did Aquinas or Anselm of Canterbury, but on outcomes—his famous wager. By applying to the existence of God the same rules that governed the existence and position of the universe itself, Pascal sounded the death knell for medieval ""certainties"" and paved the way for modern thinking.","Biography,History,Nonfiction,Science,Religion,Philosophy,Science,Mathematics",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1217051082l/115715.jpg,60766913,https://goodreads.com/book/show/115715.Pascal_s_Wager,240,3.48,20,Pascal's Wager: The Man Who Played Dice with God,130
Don Mann,"The Inside Story of America's Ultimate Warriors, When Osama bin Laden was assassinated, the entire world was fascinated by the men who had completed the seemingly impossible mission that had dogged the U.S. government for over a decade. SEAL Team 6 became synonymous with heroism, duty, and justice. Only a handful of the elite men who make up the SEALs, the US Navy's best and bravest, survive the legendary and grueling selection process that leads to becoming a member of Team 6, a group so classified it technically does not even exist. There are no better warriors on Earth. ,Don Mann knows what it takes to be a brother in this ultra-selective fraternity. As a member of Seal Team Six for over eight years and a SEAL for over seventeen years, he worked in countless covert operations, operating from land, sea, and air, and facing shootings, decapitations, and stabbings. He was captured by the enemy and lived to tell the tale, and he participated in highly classified missions all over the globe, including Somalia, Panama, El Salvador, Colombia, Afghanistan, and Iraq. As a coordinator for several civilian SEAL training programs, and as a former Training Officer of SEAL Team Six, he was directly responsible for shaping the bodies and minds of SEALs who carried out the assassination of Osama bin Laden. ,But to become a SEAL, Mann had to overcome his own troubled childhood and push his body to its breaking point--and beyond. INSIDE SEAL TEAM 6 is a high octane narrative of physical and mental toughness, giving unprecedented insight to the inner workings of the training and secret missions of the world's most respected and feared combat unit.","War,Military Fiction,Nonfiction,History,War,Biography,Military,Military History,Autobiography,Memoir,Audiobook,Biography,Autobiography",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1344263810l/11571839.jpg,316204315,https://goodreads.com/book/show/11571839-inside-seal-team-six,295,3.95,126,Inside SEAL Team Six: My Life and Missions with America's Elite Warriors,1307

Brandon G. Kinney,"In 1831, Joseph Smith, Jr., the founder of the Church of Christ—later to be renamed the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints—revealed that Zion, or “New Jerusalem,” was to be established in Jackson County, Missouri. Smith sent some of his followers to begin the settlement, but they were soon expelled by locals who were suspicious of their religion and their abolitionist sympathies. Smith led an expedition to regain the settlement, but was unsuccessful. Seven years later, in January 1838, Smith fled to Missouri from Ohio to avoid a warrant for his arrest, and joined the Mormon community in the town of Far West, which became the new Zion. The same prejudices recurred and the Mormons found themselves subject to attacks from non-Mormons, including attempts to prevent them from voting. Despite his abhorrence of violence, Smith decided that it was necessary for Mormons to defend themselves, which resulted in a short and sharp conflict known as the Mormon War. A covert Mormon paramilitary unit, the Danites, was formed to pillage non- Mormon towns, while angry rhetoric rose from both sides. After the Missouri state militia was attacked at the Battle of Crooked River, Missouri governor Liburn William Boggs issued Executive Order 44, which called for Mormons to be “exterminated or driven from the State.” Non-Mormons responded by attacking a Mormon settlement at Haun’s Mill, killing men and boys and firing on the women. Following this massacre, the state militia surrounded Far West and arrested Smith and other Mormon leaders. Smith was tried for treason and narrowly avoided execution, but was allowed to go and join the rest of his followers who were forced from Missouri to Illinois, where they founded their next major town, Nauvoo. There, Smith would be murdered and the church would split into several factions, with Brigham Young leading the movement’s largest group to Utah.,In ,The Mormon War: Zion and the Missouri Extermination Order of 1838,, Brandon G. Kinney unravels the complex series of events that led to a religious and ideological war of both blood and words. The Mormon War not only challenged the protection afforded by the First Amendment, it foreshadowed the partisan violence over slavery and states’ rights that would erupt across Missouri and Kansas. The war also fractured Smith’s Church and led ultimately to the unexpected settlement of a vast area of the West as a Mormon homeland. By tracing the life of Joseph Smith, Jr. and his quest for Zion, the author reveals that the religion he founded was destined for conflict—both internal and external—as long as he remained its leader.","North American Hi...,American History,History,Religion,Nonfiction,Historical",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1347513675l/11572608.jpg,1594161305,https://goodreads.com/book/show/11572608-the-mormon-war,288,3.18,16,The Mormon War: Zion and the Missouri Extermination Order of 1838,50
Pamela Blais,"Urban sprawl – low-density subdivisions and business parks, big box stores and mega-malls – has increasingly come to define city growth despite decades of planning and policy. In ,Perverse Cities,, Pamela Blais argues that flawed public policies and mis-pricing create hidden, “perverse” subsidies and incentives that promote sprawl while discouraging more efficient and sustainable urban forms – clearly not what most planners and environmentalists have in mind.

Jane Robinson,"She was a black woman, and she flouted convention. In an age that put ladies in the parlor and preferred them to be seen and not heard, she was nursing the British wounded, not in hospital wards with Florence Nightingale but on the Crimean battlefields—and off them, she was running a restaurant and hotel. She purveyed homemade pickles in England; she mined for gold in Panama. For unabashed individuality, Mary Jane Grant Seacole knew no peer. Yet Punch, the Times, the Illustrated London News all ardently touted her, and Queen Victoria herself entertained her. Mary Seacole—childless widow of Horatio Nelson's godson and ""good ole Mother Seacole"" to the soldiers at Sebastopol—was Britain's first black heroine, and this robust, engaging biography by social historian Jane Robinson shows why.

"Emanuel Swedenborg,Gregory R. Johnson,Jonathan S. Rose,George F. Dole","Divine Love and Wisdom, has been called the most profound work of the Enlightenment scientist and seer Emanuel Swedenborg.

Its vivid depiction of the spiritual mechanism of the world has impressed thinkers such as William Blake, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Ralph Waldo Emerson, and Henry James Sr.,This volume contains an introduction by Gregory R. Johnson that puts the work in the context of the history of philosophy.,The New Century Edition of the Works of Emanuel Swedenborg is a modern-language, scholarly translation of Swedenborg’s theological works.

Julia Flynn Siler,"Around 200 A.D., intrepid Polynesians arrived at an undisturbed archipelago. For centuries, their descendants lived with little contact from the western world. In 1778, their isolation was shattered with the arrival of Captain Cook., Deftly weaving together a memorable cast of characters, ,Lost Hawaii, brings to life the ensuing clash between a vulnerable Polynesian people and relentlessly expanding capitalist powers. Portraits of royalty and rogues, sugar barons, and missionaries combine into a sweeping tale of the Hawaiian Kingdom’s rise and fall., At the center of the story is Lili‘uokalani, the last queen of Hawai‘i. Born in 1838, she lived through the nearly complete economic transformation of the islands. Lucrative sugar plantations gradually subsumed the majority of the land, owned almost exclusively by white planters, dubbed the “Sugar Kings.” Hawai‘i became a prize in the contest between America, Britain, and France, each seeking to expand their military and commercial influence in the Pacific., The monarchy had become a figurehead, victim to manipulation from the wealthy sugar plantation owners. Lili‘uokalani was determined to enact a constitution to reinstate the monarchy’s power but was outmaneuvered by the U.S. The annexation of Hawai‘i had begun, ushering in a new century of American imperialism.","History,Nonfiction,North American Hi...,American History,Politics,Biography,Historical,Adult,Literature,19th Century,Audiobook,Womens",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1328824062l/11574167.jpg,802120016,https://goodreads.com/book/show/11574167-lost-kingdom,307,3.65,183,"Lost Kingdom: Hawaii's Last Queen, the Sugar Kings and America's First Imperial Adventure",854

This initial volume of the Collected Works offers, for the first time in English, Edith Stein's unabridged autobiography depicting herself as a child and a young adult. Her text breaks abruptly because the Gestapo arrested and deported her to Auschwitz in 1942. Edith Stein is one of the most significant German women of our century. At the age of twenty-five she became the first assistant to the founder of phenomenology, Edmund Husserl. She was much in demand as a writer-lecturer after her conversion from atheism to Catholicism. Later, as a Carmelite nun, she maintained her intellectual pursuits, until she died along with so many other Jewish people in the Holocaust. By making this story available in English, the Institute of Carmelite Studies provides an eye-witness account of persons and activities on the scene at the time when psychology and philosophy became separate disciplines.

But the turmoil of war hides layers of dangerous secrets, and a Welsh immigrant nursing wounds old and new must overcome ancient hatreds to honor justice.,Thousands of Irishmen serve valiantly on the fields of battle, yet others deny that the South's rebellion is any concern of theirs.

Lawrence A. Hoffman,"Central to both biblical narrative and rabbinic commentary, circumcision has remained a defining rite of Jewish identity, a symbol so powerful that challenges to it have always been considered taboo. Lawrence Hoffman seeks to find out why circumcision holds such an important place in the Jewish psyche. He traces the symbolism of circumcision through Jewish history, examining its evolution as a symbol of the covenant in the post-exilic period of the Bible and its subsequent meaning in the formative era of Mishnah and Talmud.,In the rabbinic system, Hoffman argues, circumcision was neither a birth ritual nor the beginning of the human life cycle, but a rite of covenantal initiation into a male ""life line."" Although the evolution of the rite was shaped by rabbinic debates with early Christianity, the Rabbis shared with the church a view of blood as providing salvation. Hoffman examines the particular significance of circumcision blood, which, in addition to its salvific role, contrasted with menstrual blood to symbolize the gender dichotomy within the rabbinic system. His analysis of the Rabbis' views of circumcision and menstrual blood sheds light on the marginalization of women in rabbinic law. Differentiating official mores about gender from actual practice, Hoffman surveys women's spirituality within rabbinic society and examines the roles mothers played in their sons' circumcisions until the medieval period, when they were finally excluded.","Religion,Judaism,Religion",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1328873515l/1157545.jpg,226347842,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1157545.Covenant_of_Blood,262,3.89,4,Covenant of Blood: Circumcision and Gender in Rabbinic Judaism,9

Sarah      Jones,"Sarah had lived in fear for over a decade. Humiliated, ostracised and brainwashed, her spirit had been crushed. But as the realisation of what she was subjecting her children to began to sink in, she found new strength and determination -- the strength to try to escape the world that had consumed her for so long. Sarah was never a troublesome child. She smoked and drank a bit when she was underage, and shoplifted once, but she was generally well-behaved and didn't mean to upset her mum and dad. But Sarah's parents had seen first hand what could happen when a teenager went off the rails. Scared the same would happen to Sarah, they sent her away, many miles from home, to a church school that would put a stop to her bad behaviour. They had no idea they were sending Sarah to a place where she would be forced into obedience -- a place that sanctioned force-feeding and beating in order to smash a child's will. They had no idea she would end up marrying a boy from the cult, and cutting the rest of her family out of her life. Or that she would begin to treat her own children in the same way -- believing there was no other option, and that everyone in the outside world was evil. But she did. And the day they sent Sarah away to the little church school miles from home was the last time they saw their real daughter for over a decade. Until one day when Sarah found the courage to fight back, the strength to protect her children and bravely venture into the world she believed was full of evil.

Todd C. Riniolo,"In 1975, the Environmental Fund sponsored a full-page advertisement in leading newspapers, which predicted that ""the world as we know it will likely be ruined before the year 2,000,"" due to the assumed inability of world food production to keep pace with the increase in population. The statement was endorsed by some of the finest thinkers of the time—scientists, scholars, and other professionals who had spent their careers applying the principles of critical thinking to their chosen disciplines. Nonetheless, in this instance, they all failed to use the same rigor in assessing the probability of looming disaster and badly miscalculated. , This is just one example of how even the best thinkers can sometimes go astray, and it illustrates how easily unconscious biases can undermine the critical thinking process. In this insightful analysis of the mental pitfalls that trip up even elite critical thinkers, psychologist Todd C. Riniolo makes a compelling case that under certain circumstances everyone is vulnerable to accepting erroneous beliefs. ,Riniolo begins by reviewing the hallmarks of critical thinking related to the evaluation of claims, such as the use of the double-blind procedure and the law of parsimony. He then provides an evolutionary framework and empirical supporting evidence from cognitive psychology to explain why being inconsistent in the use of critical thinking is part of our evolutionary heritage. Each of us possesses cognitive biases that make us prone to maintaining our current beliefs (both true and false). He concludes by focusing on a wide range of claims—environmental, political, economic, multicultural—to illustrate how in certain contexts we all are tempted to abandon critical thinking.,Thoroughly researched yet written in a lively, witty style, this unique approach to critical thinking will interest students, teachers, and anyone who wishes to become a better thinker.","Philosophy,Skepticism,Nonfiction,Science",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1365462921l/1157591.jpg,1591025869,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1157591.When_Good_Thinking_Goes_Bad,236,3.57,1,When Good Thinking Goes Bad: How Your Brain Can Have a Mind of Its Own,7

David Cressy,"Coming Over discusses the 17th century English migration to New England & shows the importance of English connections in the lives of colonists. Cressy reviews the information available to prospective migrants, the decisions they had to reach & the actions necessary before they could migrate. Englishmen & women moved with a variety of motives, a multitude of circumstances. Puritanism, involving religious harassment in England & the desire to follow God's ordinances, was only one of many factors impelling people to move. Rather than developing in wilderness isolation, the society & culture of 17th-century New England were shaped by their English roots. A two-way flow of correspondence, messages & information linked colonists to the homeland. Family duties, political sympathies, friendships, business & legal obligations all led to a continuing attachment across the Atlantic.

Rafael Concepcion,"When it comes to HDR, only three key ingredients are needed: hardware, software, and post-processing technique. Hardware is simple--there are only a few things you need to set up and shoot an HDR series. Software is vastly improved, making it easier for anyone to create an HDR image. The hard part is the post-processing technique. There are only two options: hours and hours of experimentation or ""The HDR Book."" , Featuring real-world interviews with passionate HDR photographers, ""The HDR Book,"" by Rafael ""RC"" Concepcion, is more than a how-to and different from any other HDR book out there. While other books on HDR tend to lean toward the esoteric or formulaic, this book takes another approach. It's a complete and total HDR workshop that teaches you the one thing that most other books miss- once you've tone mapped your image with HDR software, you're still not finished. , Within the pages of this book, you'll find 10 projects shot with everything from a point-and-shoot to a 37-megapixel, medium-format camera. The projects are designed to show you how the subtle differences in each scenario (lighting, subject, environment, etc.) dictate the post-processing needed to achieve one of the many final looks covered. You'll learn not only the different tone map settings RC used, but you'll also learn the final steps taken in Photoshop to complete each image. Then, you'll recreate these looks your self using the exact same RAW files that RC used Plus, you get four bonus images to play with and create your own look. The end result: a more intrinsic understanding of the nuances of HDR that will help you create the images you've always wanted. , Best of all, ""The HDR Book"" is written using the three top HDR processing programs in the industry today: Photoshop's HDR Pro, Photomatix Pro, and HDR Efex Pro. No matter which program you use, you'll be able to follow along and create your own stunning looks in no time.","Art,Photography,Nonfiction",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348601864l/11578600.jpg,321776895,https://goodreads.com/book/show/11578600-the-hdr-book,336,3.81,3,The HDR Book: Unlocking the Secrets of High Dynamic Range Photography,74

Also includes how Academia deals with studying 'the Weird', and how Academia deals with having Magicians in their ranks in the first place (aka 'Reflexivity'), plus a host of tangential issues including Satan in advertising, Drugs, the Millennium Bug and 'End-Times Fever', Andrew Chumbley, Sex Magick, Inversion and Carnival, Witchcraft, neoPaganism and Wicca, Harry Potter, Breaking Taboos, Sigmund Freud, the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, the madness of Montague Summers, Black and White magic, Censorship, how Tolkien and CS Lewis made magical belief the majority view in Britain, Genesis P Orridge, Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, Thatcherite Politics and Magic, Oscar Wilde and homosexual moral panics, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Satanic Ritual Abuse, Bela Lugosi, messages decoded from a dead squid and the cabbalistic importance of a cat called Tibbles. Not just a book about the history of magic, this research places magicians and their work into the broader society that we all live in, and shows how that magic has always been a part of our culture.","Fantasy,Magic,Nonfiction,Occult,Magick,Philosophy,Thelema,History",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348042282l/1157889.jpg,955523702,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1157889.The_History_of_British_Magic_After_Crowley,440,3.96,3,The History of British Magic After Crowley,23

Cartoonist Jim Toomey has mastered the look and personality of the creatures that his readers have come to love: Sherman and his significant-shark-other Megan, Fillmore the turtle, Hawthorne the cranky hermit crab, and other coral critters.

"Elsa Morante,Lily Tuck","History, was written nearly thirty years after Elsa Morante and Alberto Moravia spent a year in hiding among remote farming villages in the mountains south of Rome. There she witnessed the full impact of the war and first formed the ambition to write an account of what history - the great political events driven by men of power, wealth, and ambition - does when it reaches the realm of ordinary people struggling for life and bread., The central character in this powerful and unforgiving novel is Ida Mancuso, a schoolteacher whose husband has died and whose feckless teenage son treats the war as his playground. A German soldier on his way to North Africa rapes her, falls in love with her, and leaves her pregnant with a boy whose survival becomes Ida's passion. , Around these two other characters come and go, each caught up by the war which is like a river in flood. We catch glimpses of bombing raids, street crimes, a cattle car from which human cries emerge, an Italian soldier succumbing to frostbite on the Russian front, the dumb endurance of peasants who have lived their whole lives with nothing and now must get by with less than nothing.","Fiction,Cultural,Italy,European Literature,Italian Literature,Historical,Historical Fiction,Classics,War,Historical,Novels,Literature,Literature,20th Century",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1388594061l/1158380.jpg,1586420046,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1158380.History,754,4.26,367,History,4699

Staying a kid: ,Zits, is a comic strip about the funniest, most painfully emotionally charged, physically demanding, mentally challenging, and colorful times of our lives--adolescence. Those who are living it can relate. And those who have been through it cannot remember the time without smiling, or at least wincing at the arrogance and ignorance we all mistook as maturity during those few eternal years.,Zits: Sketchbook #1, is an inside look at life from the point of view of Jeremy, a private 15-year-old who is desperately hacking his way out of childhood and into maturity. He labors in the shadow of Chad, his perfect older brother who is away at college. Jeremy is a freshman in high school whose main pastimes are hanging out with his best friend, Hector Garcia, forming a garage band, and being amazed at his parents' spectacular ignorance about almost everything. Impatient, self-absorbed, emotional, and bored silly, Jeremy is the essence of adolescence. ,Zits, resonates with its fans because the strip contains so much truth and insight, wrapped in an uproarious context that's all too familiar to everyone who's been 15 or has parented a teenager.","Sequential Art,Comics,Humor,Sequential Art,Graphic Novels,Fiction,Comics,Comic Book,Sequential Art,Comic Strips,Graphic Novels Comics,Sequential Art,Bande Dessinée,Young Adult,Comics Manga",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348815505l/1158396.jpg,836268253,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1158396.Zits,128,4.06,11,Zits,1691
"John D'Agata,Jim Fingal","Now a Broadway Play.,An innovative essayist and his fact-checker do battle about the use of truth and the definition of nonfiction.,How negotiable is a fact? In 2003, after publishing his book of experimental essays, ,Halls of Fame,, John D’Agata was approached by ,Harper’s, magazine to write an essay for them, one that was eventually rejected due to disagreements related to its fact checking. That essay which eventually became the foundation of D’Agata’s critically acclaimed ,About a Mountain, was accepted by another magazine, the ,Believer,, but not before they handed it to their own fact-checker, Jim Fingal. What resulted from that assignment, and beyond the essay’s eventual publication in the magazine, was seven years of arguments, negotiations, and revisions as D’Agata and Fingal struggled to navigate the boundaries of literary nonfiction.,This book includes an early draft of D’Agata’s essay, along with D’Agata and Fingal’s extensive discussion around the text. What emerges is a brilliant and eye-opening meditation on the relationship between “truth” and “accuracy” and a penetrating conversation about whether it is appropriate for a writer to substitute one for the other.","Nonfiction,Writing,Essays,Language,Writing,Writing,Journalism,Writing,Books About Books,Plays,Philosophy,Criticism,Literary Criticism,Humanities,Language,Academic",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1347400587l/11583972.jpg,393340732,https://goodreads.com/book/show/11583972-the-lifespan-of-a-fact,128,3.83,236,The Lifespan of a Fact,1289

To Richard and Iona Miller the transformation goes far deeper than that-it is an inner change which leads to wholeness integration and flowering of the total personality.

Steve Levine,"Remote, forbidding, and volatile, the Caspian Sea long tantalized the world with its vast oil reserves. But outsiders, blocked by the closed Soviet system, couldn’t get to it. Then the Soviet Union collapsed, and a wholesale rush into the region erupted. Along with oilmen, representatives of the world’s leading nations flocked to the Caspian for a share of the thirty billion barrels of proven oil reserves at stake, and a tense geopolitical struggle began. The main players were Moscow and Washington–the former seeking to retain control of its satellite states, and the latter intent on dislodging Russia to the benefit of the West. ,The Oil and the Glory, is the gripping account of this latest phase in the epochal struggle for control of the earth’s “black gold.” Steve LeVine, who was based in the region for ,The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times,, and ,Newsweek,, weaves an astonishing tale of high-stakes political gamesmanship, greed, and scandal, set in one of the most opaque corners of the world. In LeVine’s telling, the world’s energy giants jockey for position in the rich Kazakh and Azeri oilfields, while superpowers seek to gain a strategic foothold in the region and to keep each other in check. At the heart of the story is the contest to build and operate energy pipelines out of the landlocked region, the key to controlling the Caspian and its oil. The oil pipeline that resulted, the longest in the world, is among Washington’s greatest foreign policy triumphs in at least a decade and a half. ,Along the way, LeVine introduces such players as James Giffen, an American moneyman who was also the political “fixer” for oil companies eager to do business on the Caspian and the broker for Kazakhstan’s president and ministers; John Deuss, the flamboyant Dutch oil trader who won big but lost even bigger; Heydar Aliyev, the oft-misunderstood Azeri president who transcended his past as a Soviet Politburo member and masterminded a scheme to loosen Russian control over its former colonies in the Caspian region; and all manner of rogues, adventurers, and others drawn by the irresistible pull of untold riches and the possible “final frontier” of the fossil-fuel era. The broader story is of the geopolitical questions of the Caspian oil bonanza, such as whether Russia can be a trusted ally and trading partner with the West, and what Washington’s entry into this important but chaotic region will mean for its long-term stability.,In an intense and suspenseful narrative,, The Oil and the Glory, is the definitive chronicle of events that are understood by few, but whose political and economic impact will be both profound and lasting.,""The collapse of the Soviet Union was a big opportunity for Big Oil, whose exploits are detailed in this fast-paced work of political and economic reportage by ,Wall Street Journal, energy correspondent LeVine.,Westerners had been sniffing for black gold in Russia and its satellites long before the empire disintegrated, notes the author. Averell Harriman, “the Harvard-trained scion of nineteenth-century robber baron Edward Harriman,” tried his hand at the business before turning to manganese mining, while Armand Hammer “became a money launderer for the Bolsheviks, sneaked cash to secret Bolshevik agents in the United States, and profited handsomely as the representative in Russia of some thirty American companies.” Hammer set the tone for the Americans who flocked to the Caspian in the first years of the Clinton presidency, which maneuvered for the construction of an east-west oil pipeline that, by reversing the old pattern of Central Asian materials going north to Russia and coming back as products for sale, “would favor the West and disfavor Russia.” Not a nice way to treat a fledgling democracy, but the oil scouts, of course, considered Russia a rival for Central-Asian resources second only to Iran, with its heartfelt and long-standing enmity toward the United States in the region and abroad. These scouts–the first among equals being LeVine’s heart-of-darkness antihero, Jim Giffen–kept their distance when Russia still had control over the area, spurning a Gorbachev-era program to allow foreign co-ownership. But they rushed to support separatist movements and encouraged ethnic and political divisions that opened the door to an even bigger share of the wealth. The tale of Giffen’s rise and fall (the latter for perhaps surprising reasons) occupies much of the later pages, but he never loses sight of the bigger picture: namely, Central Asia as oil lamp and potential powder keg in the realpolitik of the next few years.,A complex story rendered comprehensible, with much drama and intrigue.""--KIRKUS","Cultural,Russia,History,Business,Nonfiction,Economics,Cultural,Asia",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1320557995l/1158554.jpg,375506144,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1158554.The_Oil_and_the_Glory,496,3.99,26,The Oil and the Glory: The Pursuit of Empire and Fortune on the Caspian Sea,197

Brian Moore,"Moore's suave, ample professionalism is the saving grace of this lightweight, rather contrived Search-for-identity novel. Jamie Mangan, 36, only a young Canadian cub reporter and poet when he first met and married film star Beatrice Abbot years ago, is left with all her considerable monies after she's killed in a car crash (along with the man she'd only recently left Jamie for). After all these years of being Mr. Beatrice Abbot, as well as a cuckold, Jamie is sorely in need of an ego-transplant. Then, on a visit home to Montreal after Beatrice's death, he finds among his father's possessions some Mangan family documents, including a photograph of James Clarence Mangan, a 19th-century Irish versifier popularly considered ""Europe's first poete maudite"" - and, astoundingly, the spitting image of Jamie himself. So, newly wealthy and independent, Jamie hies himself off to Ireland in search of this new avenue of personal identity. In the little town of Dinshane, he finds Mangans aplenty, but of two separate strands: black sheep and white. It takes the rest of the book to figure out the origins of this discrepancy in behavior and outlook, ending in a revelation of incest, past gruesome injuries, and madness - pure hokum, but for the fact that Moore waltzes you so smoothly into it. Appreciate the narrative savoir-faire; enjoy even the shamelessly sentimental ending; but don't expect much grab or impact from this stylish roots-digging trifle.","Fiction,Cultural,Ireland,European Literature,Irish Literature,Literature,20th Century,Cultural,Canada,Literature,Gothic,Novels,Literary Fiction,Classics",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1181492342l/1158573.jpg,6548334,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1158573.The_Mangan_Inheritance,330,3.53,39,The Mangan Inheritance,240

A brilliant logician, an eccentric who follows his own rules, this old-style cop is beleaguered by the virulent crime wave that has engulfed his city. While political uncertainty over separatism has damaged Montreal's social and economic life, organized crime has been quick to take advantage. The Russian Mafia, rival motorcycle gangs, and infiltrators from the CIA are engaged in violent turf wars, while the police force - teeming with corruption - struggles to keep the city safe. Even Cinq-Mars, whose stunning arrests have made him a local hero, appears to have been compromised. How has he managed to penetrate Montreal's criminal elite?

Edward S. Curtis,"Mythologies and rites of Native Americans fascinated enthographer/photographer Edward Sheriff Curtis. During his journeys in the United States, Canada, and Alaska, from the 1890s through to the 1930s, these aspects of tribal life, recorded extensively on film and in text, played a large part in Curtis's multi-volume publication, The North American Indian. Masquerades, body painting, scarring, and other ritual-related transformations were parts of the cultures of many native nations. Some tribes crafted elaborate masks and costumes to impersonate deities in their highly meaningful ceremonies and celebrations. Two peoples in particular had especially rich masking traditions - the Kwakiutl of British Columbia and the Navaho of tbe American Southwest. In Hidden Faces, striking images of these sacred dramatic displays and the characters depicted have been selected by Curtis expert Christopher Cardozo. Accompanying text, excerpted from Curtis's own writings, explains the role and identity of each image. In many cases, traditional rites had already been lost or were no longer performed by the time of Curtis's arrival. His photographs thus serve a dual purpose, as a record preserving a vivid native religious and cultural tradition and as a powerful artistic expression.","Art,Photography,History,Native American History,Nonfiction,Art",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1441822578l/1158750.jpg,821223593,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1158750.Hidden_Faces,95,4.27,3,Hidden Faces,15

"Albert Cossery,Thomas W. Cushing","Early in ""Proud Beggars,"" a brutal and motiveless murder is committed in a Cairo brothel. But the real mystery at the heart of Albert Cossery's wry black comedy is not the cause of this death but the paradoxical richness to be found in even the most materially impoverished life. ,Chief among Cossery's proud beggars is Gohar, a former professor turned whorehouse accountant, hashish aficionado, and street philosopher. Such is his native charm that he has accumulated a small coterie that includes Yeghen, a rhapsodic poet and drug dealer, and El Kordi, an ineffectual clerk and would-be revolutionary who dreams of rescuing a consumptive prostitute. The police investigator Nour El Dine, harboring a dark secret of his own, suspects all three of the murder but finds himself captivated by their warm good humor. How is it that they live amid degrading poverty, yet possess a joie de vivre that even the most assiduous forces of state cannot suppress? Do they, despite their rejection of social norms and all ambition, hold the secret of contentment? And so this short novel, considered one of Cossery's masterpieces, is at once biting social commentary, police procedural, and a mischievous delight in its own right.","Fiction,Northern Africa,Egypt,Cultural,France,European Literature,French Literature,Cultural,Africa,Mystery,Classics,Literature,20th Century,Novels,African Literature,Egyptian Literature",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1324498089l/11588966.jpg,1590174631,https://goodreads.com/book/show/11588966-proud-beggars,208,4.04,95,Proud Beggars,730

With open yet critical minds, the contributors seek to analyze Venezuela’s Bolivarian democratic experience through empirical research. In doing so, they reveal a nuanced process, a richer and more complex one than is conveyed in international journalism and scholarship exclusively focused on the words and actions of Hugo Chávez.Contributors,Carolina Acosta-Alzuru,Julia Buxton,Luis Duno Gottberg,Sujatha Fernandes,María Pilar García-Guadilla,Kirk A.

Gary S. Rosenkrantz,"Many contemporary philosophers are interested in the scotistic notion of haecceity or thisness' because it is relevant to important problems concerning identity and individuation, reference, modality, and propositional attitudes. Haecceity is the only book-length work devoted to this topic. The author develops a novel defense of Platonism, arguing, first, that abstracta - nonqualitative haecceities - are needed to explain concreta's being diverse at a time; and second, that unexemplified haecceities are then required to accommodate the full range of cases in which there are possible worlds containing individuals not present in the actual world. In the cognitive area, an original epistemic argument is presented which implies that certain haecceities can be grasped by a person: his own, those of certain of his mental states, and those of various abstracta, but not those of external things. It is argued that in consequence there is a clear sense in which one is directly acquainted with the former entities, but not with external things.","Philosophy,Philosophy,Metaphysics",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1356348206l/11590032.jpg,904814311X,https://goodreads.com/book/show/11590032-haecceity,256,4,0,Haecceity: An Ontological Essay,1

Jeff Benedict,"Out of Bounds: Inside the NBA's Culture of Rape, Violence, and Crime, is a searing indictment of professional basketball players who live in a world where criminal laws and social norms don't exist, a world where they are given license to act above the law.,On the court, they dazzle us with their spectacular physical feats. They generate millions of dollars of revenue for the NBA and their teams. They inspire adulation. But underneath all the glitz, the money, and alley-oops is a seamy underbelly, a rash of lawlessness that is gripping the NBA.,Based on a first-of-its-kind investigation into the criminal histories of 177 NBA players from the 2001–2002 season, Out of Bounds shows that an alarming four out of every ten NBA players have a police record involving a serious crime. They are All-Stars and they are journeymen, involved in crimes ranging from armed robbery to domestic violence to gun possession to rape.,Out of Bounds, takes a hard look at shocking cases, with graphic accounts of physical and sexual violence and other outrageous conduct by players. In all, more than 250 people are named, including many prominent NBA players. It exposes the environment and culture that encourages such criminal behavior. It also explains the unique challenges these cases pose for law-enforcement agencies and prosecutors. And ,Out of Bounds, takes readers inside the hidden yet critically vital role that lawyers, agents, and fame play in insulating criminally accused players from accountability.,Author Jeff Benedict, an expert on athletes and crime, draws his conclusions from exhaustive research. In addition to his criminal-background checks, the author retrieved documents from law-enforcement agencies, courts, and private attorneys. He conducted more than 400 interviews with police officers, prosecutors, defense lawyers, players, agents, victims, witnesses, and coaches. What emerges is a disturbing and appalling picture of men who live above the law.,A seminal and important work, ,Out of Bounds, will forever change how we look at the NBA and its stars' lives of excess and privilege.","Sports,Sports,Nonfiction,Sports,Basketball,Mystery,Crime",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1415585428l/1159019.jpg,60726040,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1159019.Out_of_Bounds,304,3.41,13,"Out of Bounds: Inside the NBA's Culture of Rape, Violence, and Crime",109

Wiebke Kuklys,"Kuklys examines how Nobel Prize-winning economist Amartya Sen s approach to welfare measurement can be put in practice for poverty and inequality measurement in affluent societies such as the UK. Sen argues that an individual s welfare should not be measured in terms of her income, but in terms what she can actually do or be, her capabilities. In Chapters 1 and 2, Kuklys describes the capability approach from a standard welfare economic point of view and provides a comprehensive literature review of the empirical applications in this area of research. In the remaining chapters, novel econometric techniques are employed to operationalise the concepts of functionings and capability to investigate inequality and poverty in terms of capability in the UK. Kuklys finds that capability measurement is always a useful complement to traditional monetary analysis, and particularly so in the case of capability-deprived disabled individuals.""","International Dev...,Human Development",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1328043682l/11590499.jpg,3642065627,https://goodreads.com/book/show/11590499-amartya-sen-s-capability-approach,116,4,1,Amartya Sen's Capability Approach: Theoretical Insights and Empirical Applications,1

Judith Pascoe,"This book is... a romantic history of romantic collecting. It takes seriously, and by necessity shares, the tendency of romantic histories to dwell upon their own fragmentariness, on the impossibility of capturing an intact history.... It traces the particular ways in which objects stepped into the lives of romantic collectors, and also the ways in which the objects moved on.--from the IntroductionIn the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, the activity of collecting became democratized and popularized, allowing all kinds of people to become caught up in the collecting obsessions of the period: birds, books, Napoleonic relics, botanical specimens, Egyptiana, and fossils. Judith Pascoe invites readers to contemplate the ongoing allure of romantic collections. Pascoe maintains that romanticism as a literary movement played a crucial supporting role in varied attempts by collectors of this era to fashion identities for themselves through collecting. She links the collecting craze during the period with the subsequent fetishization of romantic poets and their possessions, revealing the extent to which an ongoing fascination with material objects--with Keats's hair and Shelley's guitar, for example--helped to produce an enduring image of these poets as spiritual emissaries of a less materialistic age. In language both witty and idiosyncratic, Pascoe makes the case that the romantic period stands out as a distinct moment in collecting history, a transition between the flourishing of the Renaissance wonder cabinet and the rise of the Victorian museum.","History,Nonfiction",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348030601l/1159073.jpg,801443628,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1159073.The_Hummingbird_Cabinet,222,3.67,3,The Hummingbird Cabinet: A Rare and Curious History of Romantic Collectors,15
Jeffrey Herf,"A significant new look at the legacy of the Nazi regime, this book exposes the workings of past beliefs and political interests in how - and how differently - the two Germanys have recalled the crimes of Nazism, from the anti-Nazi emigration of the 1930s through the establishment of a day of remembrance for the victims of National Socialism in 1996. Why, Jeffrey Herf asks, would German politicians raise the specter of crimes at all, in view of the considerable depth and breadth of support the Nazis held during their reign? Why did the public memory of Nazi anti-Jewish persecution and the Holocaust emerge, if selectively, in West Germany, yet was repressed and marginalized in ""anti-fascist"" East Germany? And how do the politics of left and right come into play in this divided memory? The answers reveal the surprising relationship between how the crimes of Nazism were publicly recalled and how East and West Germany separately evolved a Communist dictatorship and a liberal democracy. This book, for the first time, points to the impact of the Cold War confrontation in both West and East Germany on the public memory of anti-Jewish persecution and the Holocaust.","History,Cultural,Germany,World War II,Holocaust,Nonfiction,History,European History,War,World War II",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1347842668l/1159081.jpg,674213041,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1159081.Divided_Memory,527,3.76,4,Divided Memory: The Nazi Past in the Two Germanys,49

Edward Hooper,"While science has devoted much of its efforts to finding a cure for AIDS, the sources of this deadly epidemic remain largely unexamined. Distinguished science journalist Edward Hooper presents the meticulously researched -- and highly readable -- history of HIV and its possible origins. Pursuing leads across the U.S., the Caribbean, Europe, and Africa, Hooper pieces together the tantalizing clues offered by long-archived blood samples, early AIDS-like cases (such as the ""Manchester sailor"" case of 1959), immunodeficiency viruses (SIVs), and the medical interventions in Africa and elsewhere that may have played a role in SIVs' crossover into humans.Hooper examines over two dozen theories of origin, and eventually discards most of them. What remains is a remarkable and well-supported theory for the sudden appearance of AIDS, and the definitive story of its lethal spread. Drawing on more than 4,000 sources and 600 interviews, The River is a thorough and provocative investigation into the most terrible epidemic of the twentieth century.","Science,Nonfiction,History,Cultural,Africa,Health,Health,Medicine,Illness,Disease",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1387742243l/1159147.jpg,316372617,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1159147.The_River_,1070,4.07,35,The River : A Journey to the Source of HIV and AIDS,221
Jon C. Stott,"During the 1980s, the geography of minor-league professional hockey changed radically, moving from its roots in the Canadian Maritime provinces, New England and the Midwestern states into the American south. In addition to cities like Dallas, Charlotte, Norfolk and Oklahoma City, which had long traditions of minor-league hockey, unlikely places such as Biloxi, Baton Rouge, Little Rock and Augusta hosted teams. Over an 18-year period, minor-league hockey was played in 72 different southern cities, and at one point there were more minor-league teams in Texas than in all of Canada, making Texas the place where many players learned their hockey skills.,Hockey Night in Dixie, examines this phenomenon with an historical overview of the period, including interviews with people involved in the founding and early years of each of the 13 leagues. There are also in-depth portraits of four teams, one from each of the four lower minor leagues that played during the 2005-06 season.

Linda Perlstein,"The pressure is on at schools across America. In recent years, reforms such as No Child Left Behind have created a new vision of education that emphasizes provable results, uniformity, and greater attention for floundering students. Schools are expected to behave more like businesses and judged almost solely on the bottom line: test scores.,To see if this world is producing better students, Linda Perlstein immersed herself in a suburban Maryland elementary school. The resulting portrait -- detailed, human, and truly thought-provoking -- is marked by the same narrative gifts and expertise that made Not Much Just Chillin' so illuminating.,The school, once deemed a failure, is now held up as an example of reform done right. Perlstein explores the rewards and costs of that transformation, through the experiences of the people who lived it. Nine-year-olds meditate to activate their brains before exams and kindergartners write paragraphs. Teachers attempt to address diverse needs at the same time they are expected to follow daily scripts, and feel compelled to focus on topics that will be tested at the expense of those that won't. The principal attempts to keep it all together, in the face of immense challenges.,Perlstein provides the first detailed view of how new education policies are modified by human realities. Tested will be talked about, thought about, written about -- and will almost certainly play an important role in the national debate as the federal education law come up for renewal.","Education,Nonfiction,Teaching,Sociology,Parenting,Writing,Journalism,Adult",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1312048450l/1159222.jpg,805080821,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1159222.Tested,320,3.96,50,Tested: One American School Struggles to Make the Grade,262

C. Stanley Ogilvy,"""A charming, entertaining, and instructive book …. The writing is exceptionally lucid, as in the author's earlier books, … and the problems carefully selected for maximum interest and elegance."" — Martin Gardner.,This book is intended for people who liked geometry when they first encountered it (and perhaps even some who did not) but sensed a lack of intellectual stimulus and wondered what was missing, or felt that the play was ending just when the plot was finally becoming interesting.,In this superb treatment, Professor Ogilvy demonstrates the mathematical challenge and satisfaction to be had from geometry, the only requirements being two simple implements (straightedge and compass) and a little thought. Avoiding topics that require an array of new definitions and abstractions, Professor Ogilvy draws upon material that is either self-evident in the classical sense or very easy to prove. Among the subjects treated are: harmonic division and Apollonian circles, inversion geometry, the hexlet, conic sections, projective geometry, the golden section, and angle trisection. Also included are some unsolved problems of modern geometry, including Malfatti's problem and the Kakeya problem.,Numerous diagrams, selected references, and carefully chosen problems enhance the text. In addition, the helpful section of notes at the back provides not only source references but also much other material highly useful as a running commentary on the text.","Science,Mathematics",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1328867990l/1159338.jpg,486265307,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1159338.Excursions_in_Geometry,192,4.47,2,Excursions in Geometry,17
"G. Edward Evans,Patricia Layzell Ward","Both organizational patterns and management strategies have changed significantly in recent years, yet little in the library administration literature takes up new trends and strategies. Social, economic, political, and--especially--technological influences on the ways that libraries are staffed, organized, and financed are in flux. ""Beyond the Basics is both a practical hands-on guide and an exceptionally well-researched examination of today's results-oriented library management strategies. Evans and Layzell Ward, two of today's most respected library management experts, look at how external forces as diverse as globalization, OCLC's recent marketing decisions, mergers of specialist software houses, new document delivery services, and the growth of electronic archives and virtual libraries affect libraries and how library managers can respond. The ways that all of this change influences communications and work patterns between library colleagues, long-and short-term planning, and organizational models are examined from various angles. New developments are considered both in the collaboration among and the competition between the public and private information delivery services. Other hot-topics treated include making career plans in an age of discontinuity, motivating staff in difficult economic times, and performing effective needs-analyses. An extensive list of additional reading and password-protected access to the book's own continually updated Web site is also included.","Library Science,Librarianship",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1181500520l/1159340.jpg,155570476X,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1159340.Beyond_The_Basics,347,3.77,0,Beyond The Basics: The Management Guide For Library And Information Professionals,13

The murder of a beautiful woman shatters the rural village peace of Alfredville, and her husband, the police station commander, is jailed as chief suspect. Her cousin Peter, a freelance writer in London, returns to South Africa for the first time in decades – unsettled, curious, but also in search of a career-defining story. ,On checking into the Queen’s Hotel he finds that things are not as straightforward as he imagined, and South Africa is not as he left it. His carefully ordered world is thrown into turmoil as his trip dredges up a long-abandoned past, forcing him to question the assumptions so easily held from the comfort of his London flat. He meets a mixture of locals, visitors, vagrants and migrants, but most momentously, Peter discovers that his bosom friend from school, Bennie Nienaber, is still in Alfredville – and is in fact now, acting station commander at the local police station. Peter re-establishes an awkward friendship with his erstwhile friend and the two warily circle each other, sharing reminiscences that hint at a bond much deeper than nostalgia. ,As Peter abandons the neatly patterned story he had planned and is forced to participate in a community that he once despised, he begins to reconsider his place in the world.

Henry Reed Hoke,"Cast your mind back to the 1940's. The United States was at war with the axis powers, Germany, Italy, and Japan. These countries had spies and agents who used the franking privilege of elected Congressman and Senators to send propaganda to ""isolationists"" and ""America Firsters"" around the country. The purpose was to break the fighting spirit on the homefront.,Henry Hoke attempted to bring three grand juries' proceedings before the public eye. Unfortunately, because powerful people were implicated, the aggressive prosecutor, Maloney, was replaced and a thorough public viewing of the case was never undertaken. ,Here is an example of what Henry Hoke refers to as gutter-literature that was inserted into franked envelopes from the office of Charlie Hoffman of Onaha, Nebraska:,It describe in an alliterative fashion the dangers of West Africa:,It proclaimed in part: ""V is Victory. These vain visionaries Would Send Our Valiant Vanguard to Africa's Vilely Vicious Clime, Victimized by Verminous Voracious insects, Venomous snakes, Vitiating tropical diseases, Voo-dooed and Hoo-dooed by the horrors of war in the hottest hell on earth."",I happen to know that Henry Hoke's youngest son, Jack, was in the US Army and sent to west Africa because Henry is my grandfather, and Jack is my uncle.,It is amazing to read about the genius propagandist named Viereck who got Congressman like Hamilton Fish to publish Nazi propaganda as their own speeches. These speeches would become part of the Congressional Record and hundred of copies were ordered from the Government Printing Office. Envelopes marked with the Congressman's frank would be passed to Nazi front organizations like America First where they would be addressed to their mailing lists. So, while the Nazi were sinking American ships and bombing American allies, Viereck found a way for American taxpayers to finance distribution of Nazi propaganda. ,According to George Sylvester Viereck book ""The Germs of Hate"", ""Propaganda is a campaign camouflaging its origin, its motive, or both, conducted for the purpose of obtaining specific objectives by manipulating public opinion.""

Thomas Homer-Dixon,"""The most persuasive forecast of the 21st century I have seen."" -- E.O. Wilson, author of ,Consilience: The Unity of Knowledge, and twice winner of a Pulitzer prize,“Human beings have been smart enough to turn nature to their ends, generate vast wealth for themselves, and double their average life span. But are they smart enough to solve the problems of the 21st century?” -- ,Thomas Homer-Dixon,Can we create ideas fast enough to solve the very problems -- environmental, social, and technological -- we’ve created? Homer-Dixon pinpoints the “ingenuity gap” as the critical problem we face today, and tackles it in a riveting, groundbreaking examination of a world that is rapidly exceeding our intellectual grasp.,In ,The Ingenuity Gap,, Thomas Homer-Dixon, ""global guru"" (the ,Toronto Star,), ""genuine academic celebrity"" (,Saturday Night,) and ""one of Canada's most talked about and controversial scholars"" (,Maclean's,) asks: is our world becoming too complex, too fast-paced to manage? The challenges facing us -- ranging from international financial crises and global climate change to pandemics of tuberculosis and AIDS- converge, intertwine, and remain largely beyond our ken. Most of suspect the ""experts don't really know what's going on; that as a species we've released forces that are neither managed nor manageable. We are fast approaching a time when we may no longer be able to control a world that increasingly exceeds our grasp. This is ""the ingenuity gap"" -- the term coined by Thomas Homer-Dixon, political scientist and advisor to the White House -- the critical gap between our need for practical, innovative ideas to solve complex problems and our actual supply of those ideas.,Through gripping narrative stories and incidents that exemplify his arguments, he takes us on a world tour that begins with a heartstopping description of the tragic crash of United Airlines Flight 232 from Denver to Chicago and includes Las Vegas in its desert, a wilderness beach in British Columbia, and his solitary search for a little girl in Patna, India. He shows how, in our complex world, while poor countries are particularly vulnerable to ingenuity gaps, our own rich countries are not immune, and we are caught dangerously between a soaring requirement for ingenuity and an increasingly uncertain supply. When the gap widens, political disintegration and violent upheaval can result, reaching into our own economies and daily lives in subtle ways. In compelling, lucid, prose, he makes real the problems we face and suggests how we might overcome them -- in our own lives, our thing, our business and our societies.","Science,Business,Economics,Social Science,Politics,Nonfiction,Science,Technology,Environment,Climate Change,Sociology",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1320415399l/1159529.jpg,676972969,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1159529.The_Ingenuity_Gap,496,3.74,31,The Ingenuity Gap: Can We Solve the Problems of the Future?,274

"Pauline Kael,Sanford Schwartz","""Film criticism is exciting just because there is no formula to apply,"" Pauline Kael once observed, ""just because you must use everything you are and everything you know."" Between 1968 and 1991, as regular film reviewer for ,The New Yorker,, Kael used those formidable tools to shape the tastes of a generation, enthralling readers with her gift for capturing, with force and fluency, the essence of an actor's gesture or the full implication of a cinematic image. Kael called movies ""the most total and encompassing art form we have,"" and she made her reviews a platform for considering both film and the worlds it engages, crafting in the process a prose style of extraordinary wit, precision, and improvisatory grace. To read ,The Age of Movies,, the first new selection in more than a generation, is to be swept up into an endlessly revealing and entertaining dialogue with Kael at her witty, exhilarating, and opinionated best. Her ability to evoke the essence of a great artist-an Orson Welles or a Robert Altman-or to celebrate the way even seeming trash could tap deeply into our emotions was matched by her unwavering eye for the scams and self-deceptions of a corrupt movie industry. Here in this career spanning collection are her appraisals of the films that defined an era-among them ,Breathless,, ,Bonnie and Clyde,, ,The Leopard,, ,The Godfather,, ,Last Tango in Paris,, ,Nashville,-along with many others, some awaiting rediscovery, all providing the occasion for masterpieces of observation and insight, alive on every page.","Culture,Film,Nonfiction,Writing,Essays,Media Tie In,Reference,History,Culture,Pop Culture,Art,Anthologies",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1330230763l/11596991.jpg,1598531093,https://goodreads.com/book/show/11596991-the-age-of-movies,828,4.21,26,The Age of Movies: Selected Writings,196

John   Dyer,"Where does technology belong in the biblical story of redemption? Believers and unbelievers alike are saturated with technology, yet most give it little if any thought. Consumers buy and upgrade as fast as they can, largely unaware of technology's subtle yet powerful influence. In a world where technology changes almost daily, many are left to wonder: Should Christians embrace all that is happening? Are there some technologies that we need to avoid? Does the Bible give us any guidance on how to use digital tools and social media?,An experienced Web developer and writer on technology and culture, John Dyer answers these questions and more by walking through the story of the Bible and introducing key ideas about how technology and culture interact. Dyer first analyzes the biblical, theological, and philosophical foundations of technology and then studies several examples that show how technology can influence the spiritual life. For youth pastors, college-aged readers, and anyone interested in understanding how technology fits with faith, ""From the Garden to the City"" fills a gap for biblically-informed literature in a technological world.,""The burgeoning field of internet possibilities has very little written from a Christian perspective, much less from a gifted artist like John Dyer.""--J.

Touraj Daryaee,"This ,Handbook, is a current, comprehensive single-volume history of Iranian civilization. The authors, all leaders in their fields, emphasize the large-scale continuities of Iranian history while also describing the important patterns of transformation that have characterized Iran's past. Each of the chapters focuses on a specific epoch of Iranian history and surveys the general political, social, cultural, and economic issues of that era. The ancient period begins with chapters considering the anthropological evidence of the prehistoric era, through to the early settled civilizations of the Iranian plateau, and continuing to the rise of the ancient Persian empires. The medieval section first considers the Arab-Muslim conquest of the seventh century, and then moves on to discuss the growing Turkish influence filtering in from Central Asia beginning in the tenth and eleventh centuries. The last third of the book covers Iran in the modern era by considering the rise of the Safavid state and its accompanying policy of centralization, the introduction of Shi'ism, the problems of reform and modernization in the Qajar and Pahlavi periods, and the revolution of 1978-79 and its aftermath. The book is a collaborative exercise among scholars specializing in a variety of sub-fields, and across a number of disciplines, including history, art history, classics, literature, politics, and linguistics. Here, readers can find a reliable and accessible narrative that can serve as an authoritative guide to the field of Iranian studies.","History,Cultural,Iran,Nonfiction",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1347682598l/11598352.jpg,199732159,https://goodreads.com/book/show/11598352-the-oxford-handbook-of-iranian-history,414,3.75,0,The Oxford Handbook of Iranian History,20

James S. Russell,"In a very short time America has realized that global warming poses real challenges to the nation's future. ,The Agile City, engages the fundamental question: what to do about it?,  , Journalist and urban analyst James S. Russell argues that we'll more quickly slow global warming-and blunt its effects-by retrofitting cities, suburbs, and towns. ,The Agile City, shows that change undertaken at the building and community level can reach carbon-reduction goals rapidly., Adapting buildings (39 percent of greenhouse-gas emission) and communities (slashing the 33 percent of transportation related emissions) offers numerous other benefits that tax gimmicks and massive alternative-energy investments can't match.,  , Rapidly improving building techniques can readily cut carbon emissions by half, and some can get to zero. These cuts can be affordably achieved in the windshield-shattering heat of the desert and the bone-chilling cold of the north. Intelligently designing our towns could reduce marathon commutes and child chauffeuring to a few miles or eliminate it entirely. Agility, Russell argues, also means learning to adapt to the effects of climate change, which means redesigning the obsolete ways real estate is financed; housing subsidies are distributed; transportation is provided; and water is obtained, distributed and disposed of. These engines of growth have become increasingly more dysfunctional both economically and environmentally.,  ,The Agile City, highlights tactics that create multiplier effects, which means that ecologically driven change can shore-up economic opportunity, can make more productive workplaces, and can help revive neglected communities. Being able to look at multiple effects and multiple benefits of political choices and private investments is essential to assuring wealth and well-being in the future. Green, Russell writes, grows the future.","Cities,Urbanism,Environment",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1328750086l/11598419.jpg,1597267244,https://goodreads.com/book/show/11598419-the-agile-city,312,3.86,3,The Agile City: Building Well-being and Wealth in an Era of Climate Change,21
"Charles  London,Charles Gerrard","The only major fleet engagement of World War I (1914-1918), the Battle of Jutland (1916) has been surrounded by controversy ever since. The British public felt Admiral Jellicoe had failed – a reaction rooted in a hundred years of the 'Nelson cult', a conviction that anything short of a Trafalgar-style annihilation was letting the side down. True, the German Fleet had sunk more ships and suffered fewer casualties, but the British had forced them to disengage and run for port and were still cruising off Denmark spoiling for a fight. This title recounts in detail how on an early summer's evening in 1916, the two fleets clashed head to head: the events that followed would spark a polemic that still rages today.","History,Military,Military History,Military History,Naval History,War,World War I,Nonfiction,War",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1320545291l/1159845.jpg,1855329921,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1159845.Jutland_1916,96,3.94,5,Jutland 1916: Clash of the Dreadnoughts,33

Jeffrey A. Winters,"For centuries, oligarchs were viewed as empowered by wealth, an idea muddled by elite theory early in the twentieth century. The common thread for oligarchs across history is that wealth defines them, empowers them, and inherently exposes them to threats. The existential motive of all oligarchs is wealth defense. How they respond varies with the threats they confront, including how directly involved they are in supplying the coercion underlying all property claims, and whether they act separately or collectively. These variations yield four types of oligarchy: warring, ruling, sultanistic, and civil. Oligarchy is not displaced by democracy but rather is fused with it. Moreover, the rule of law problem in many societies is a matter of taming oligarchs. Cases studied in this book include the United States, ancient Athens and Rome, Indonesia, the Philippines, Singapore, medieval Venice and Siena, mafia commissions in the United States and Italy, feuding Appalachian families, and early chiefs cum oligarchs dating from 2300 BCE.","History,Politics,Economics,Nonfiction,Politics,Political Science,Philosophy",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1347815863l/11598740.jpg,521182980,https://goodreads.com/book/show/11598740-oligarchy,323,4.24,19,Oligarchy,106
Kuwana Haulsey,"""The moon was red on the night my mother died. Fat, fairly bursting, as I remember, it rode so low in the sky that it grazed the backs of the leopards who hissed and spat and cursed it for interrupting the hunt. It caressed the thorny tips of the acacia trees, bending them, seeming to crush them with light."",In The Red Moon,, newcomer Kuwana Haulsey has crafted a strikingly beautiful coming-of-age story set amid the turbulent history of modern Kenya. ,The novel centers on Nasarian, the daughter of a successful Samburu herdsman and his Somali fourth wife. On the verge of adulthood, Nasarian finds herself trapped between the demands of her traditional tribal life and her desire to live abroad as a writer. When her parents die suddenly, Nasarian's plan to escape her sheltered world is undermined by her scornful brother Lolorok. Disgusted by Nasarian's refusal to be circumcised and thus initiated into the traditional role of wife and mother, Lolorok allows his sister to be inherited by a distant cousin.,Nasarian is convinced that no matter how hard she fights, she will never be allowed to call her life her own. She is dogged by the memory of her father, who was caught in the midst of a brutal war, branded with the name Mau Mau, imprisoned as a terrorist. She is haunted by the spirit of her mother, captured in a bloody raid and destined, like Nasarian, to be an outcast.,Nasarian runs away, sparking a sweeping journey of discovery that evokes fifty years and three generations of her family history. Weaving ancient myth and folklore into the tapestry of Nasarian's personal quest, The Red Moon chronicles the yearning of a brave young woman while simultaneously depicting a nation's equally fierce search for a truthful and lasting spiritual independence.,Stunning in its revelations,, The Red Moon, portrays incisively a way of life rarely glimpsed by those who have not experienced its richness and survived its terror.

Franklin E. Zimring,"The forty-percent drop in crime that occurred across the U.S. from 1991 to 2000 remains largely an unsolved mystery. Even more puzzling is the eighty-percent drop over nineteen years in New York City. Twice as long and twice as large, it is the largest crime decline on record.,In ,The City That Became Safe,, Franklin E. Zimring seeks out the New York difference through a comprehensive investigation into the city's falling crime rates. The usual understanding is that aggressive police created a zero-tolerance law enforcement regime that drove crime rates down. Is this political sound bite true-are the official statistics generated by the police accurate? Though zero-tolerance policing and quality-of-life were never a consistent part of the NYPD's strategy, Zimring shows the numbers are correct and argues that some combination of more cops, new tactics, and new management can take some credit for the decline. That the police can make a difference at all in preventing crime overturns decades of conventional wisdom from criminologists, but Zimring also points out what most experts have missed: the New York experience challenges the basic assumptions driving American crime- and drug-control policies.,New York has shown that crime rates can be greatly reduced without increasing prison populations. New York teaches that targeted harm reduction strategies can drastically cut down on drug related violence even if illegal drug use remains high. And New York has proven that epidemic levels of violent crime are not hard-wired into the populations or cultures of urban America. This careful and penetrating analysis of how the nation's largest city became safe rewrites the playbook on crime and its control for all big cities.","Nonfiction,Sociology,History,Mystery,Crime,Politics,Government,Science,Academic,School,Crime,True Crime,Culture,Society,Cities,Urbanism",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348193013l/11598788.jpg,199844429,https://goodreads.com/book/show/11598788-the-city-that-became-safe,257,3.6,13,The City That Became Safe: New York's Lessons for Urban Crime and Its Control,77

In fact the only thing stronger and more sustaining than the narrator’s fantasy life is his friendship with Rubythe kind of friendship a body is made for.","Fiction,Fantasy,Humor,Music,Fantasy,Paranormal,Contemporary,Novels",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1203399689l/1159946.jpg,947795243,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1159946.Ruby_The_Stone_Age_Diet,0,3.47,42,Ruby & The Stone Age Diet,386
Martin Millar,"Glasgow, 1972. All the coolest kids in town are lining up for Led Zeppelin tickets. Overhead, a Zeppelin approaches. Its passengers—Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin, and Hank Williams—think it’s worth leaving heaven to see the greatest rock band in the world. Even the fairies are fans. Meanwhile, nerdy Martin and his equally nerdy best friend Greg have overactive imaginations. When they aren’t fighting the monstrous hordes of Xotha, they are competing for the attentions of a popular (read: unattainable) girl named Suzy. She’s not likely to ditch Zed, the hippest boy in the school, for the likes of them, is she? Then again, with Led Zeppelin on the way, it feels like anything can happen. Suzy, Led Zeppelin, and Me takes readers on a ride through Martin’s angsty and fumbling youth, when Led Zeppelin comes to Glasgow and rocks Martin’s world, and through his angstridden and fumbling adult years, when he learns what can’t be denied: love may break your heart, but Led Zeppelin will never let you down.","Fiction,Music,Fantasy,Young Adult,Humor,Realistic Fiction,Romance,Young Adult,Coming Of Age",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1181507690l/1159948.jpg,1899598227,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1159948.Suzy_Led_Zeppelin_and_Me,203,3.87,45,"Suzy, Led Zeppelin, and Me",449
St. John D. Seymour,"1913. At the outset the plan and scope of this book must be made clear. It will be noticed that the belief in fairies and suchlike beings is hardly touched upon at all, except in those instances where fairy lore and witchcraft become inextricably blended. When did witchcraft make its appearance in Ireland, and what was its progress therein? It seems probable that this belief, together with certain aspects of fairy lore previously unknown to the Irish, and ideas relative to milk and butter magic, may in the main be counted as results of the Anglo-Norman invasion, though it is possible that an earlier installment of these came in with the Scandinavians.","History,Nonfiction,Cultural,Ireland,Occult,Religion,Religion,Paganism,European Literature,Irish Literature,Paranormal,Witches,Fantasy,Paranormal,Witchcraft",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1463631556l/1159950.jpg,088356002X,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1159950.Irish_Witchcraft_and_Demonology,0,3.4,11,Irish Witchcraft and Demonology,96
"Michael J. Durant,Steven Hartov","From the authors of the bestselling ""In the Company of Heroes"" come the thrilling, never-before-heard stories of the Army's elite aviation unit, the most daring and professional helicopter crews in the world. , In his first book, Michael Durant told his harrowing tale of being shot down in his Blackhawk over Mogadishu and held captive by a Somali warlord. It was a remarkable account, particularly because Special Operations pilots are notoriously reticent-they don't talk about their missions, at least not to anyone outside their small community. But now, with the publication of ""The Night Stalkers,"" Durant and Steven Hartov shed a fascinating light on these mysterious super commandos and take readers into a world they have only imagined. , From Iran to Grenada to Iraq, the 160th SOAR (A) has been at the point of the spear and in the thick of combat, delivering and supporting Delta operators, Rangers, and SEAL teams to any target, at any point on the globe, in all weather-night or day. Simply put, they are the best of the best, and here for the first time are their hair-raising true stories of battle, capture, victory, and loss.","War,Military Fiction,History,Nonfiction,Military,Military History,War,Aviation,Modern,Biography,Autobiography,Memoir,Historical",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1441157346l/115996._SX318_.jpg,399153926,https://goodreads.com/book/show/115996.The_Night_Stalkers,335,4.19,59,The Night Stalkers: Top Secret Missions of the U.S. Army's Special Operations Aviation Regiment,1495

Will Durant,"In the tradition of his own bestselling masterpieces ""The Story of Civilization"" and ""The Lessons of History, "" Pulitzer Prize-winning historian Will Durant here traces the lives and ideas of those who have helped to define civilization, from its dawn to the beginning of the modern world. Four years before his death, Will Durant began work on an abbreviated version of his highly acclaimed eleven-volume series, ""The Story of Civilization."" The project was conceived as a series of audio lectures, but Durant soon realized that the dialogues could be developed into a book that would serve as a wonderfully readable introduction to the subject of history.,Durant completed twenty-one of a proposed twenty-three chapters before his death in 1981, at the age of ninety-six. Those chapters span thousands of years of human history -- from Confucius to Shakespeare, from the Roman Empire to the Reformation, finally ending in the eighteenth century. The manuscript was recently found by Will Durant scholar John Little -- twenty years after Durant finished it -- and its discovery is a major event, not only for lovers of his prose, but for students of history and philosophy the world over.,""Heroes of History"" is a book of life-enhancing wisdom and optimism, complete with Durant's wit, knowledge, and unique ability to explain events and ideas in simple, exciting terms. It is the lessons of our heritage passed on for the edification and benefit of future generations -- a fitting legacy from America's most beloved historian and philosopher.,Will Durant's popularity as America's favorite teacher of history and philosophy remains undiminished by time. His books are accessible to readers of every kind, and his unique ability to compress complicated ideas and events into a few pages without ever ""talking down"" to the reader, enhanced by his memorable wit and a razor-sharp judgment about men and their motives, made all of his books huge bestsellers. ""Heroes of History"" carries on this tradition of making scholarship and philosophy understandable to the general reader, and making them good reading, as well.,At the dawn of a new millennium and the beginning of a new century, nothing could be more appropriate than this brilliant book that examines the meaning of human civilization and history and draws from the experience of the past the lessons we need to know to put the future into context and live in confidence, rather than fear and ignorance.,Will Durant's work is marked by his own special quality as a writer -- he is tough-minded, optimistic, courageous, and convinced that without a knowledge of the past there is no wisdom to guide us to the future. ""Heroes of History"" was his last word on the subject, and much of it has been aimed directly at the doubts and fears of people today. It is a major, and unexpected, literary and historical event.,This book is also available on audio tape and CD format, read by Will and Ariel Durant.

John Grisham,"The partners at Finley & Figg—all two of them—often refer to themselves as “a boutique law firm.” Boutique, as in chic, selective, and prosperous. They are, of course, none of these things. What they are is a two-bit operation always in search of their big break, ambulance chasers who’ve been in the trenches much too long making way too little. Their specialties, so to speak, are quickie divorces and DUIs, with the occasional jackpot of an actual car wreck thrown in. After twenty plus years together, Oscar Finley and Wally Figg bicker like an old married couple but somehow continue to scratch out a half-decent living from their seedy bungalow offices in southwest Chicago., ,And then change comes their way. More accurately, it stumbles in. David Zinc, a young but already burned-out attorney, walks away from his fast-track career at a fancy downtown firm, goes on a serious bender, and finds himself literally at the doorstep of our boutique firm. Once David sobers up and comes to grips with the fact that he’s suddenly unemployed, any job—even one with Finley & Figg—looks okay to him. ,With their new associate on board, F&F is ready to tackle a really big case, a case that could make the partners rich without requiring them to actually practice much law. An extremely popular drug, Krayoxx, the number one cholesterol reducer for the dangerously overweight, produced by Varrick Labs, a giant pharmaceutical company with annual sales of $25 billion, has recently come under fire after several patients taking it have suffered heart attacks. Wally smells money., ,A little online research confirms Wally’s suspicions—a huge plaintiffs’ firm in Florida is putting together a class action suit against Varrick. All Finley & Figg has to do is find a handful of people who have had heart attacks while taking Krayoxx, convince them to become clients, join the class action, and ride along to fame and fortune. With any luck, they won’t even have to enter a courtroom! ,It almost seems too good to be true. ,And it is., ,The Litigators is a tremendously entertaining romp, filled with the kind of courtroom strategies, theatrics, and suspense that have made John Grisham America’s favorite storyteller.","Fiction,Thriller,Mystery,Thriller,Legal Thriller,Mystery,Crime,Audiobook,Suspense,Thriller,Mystery Thriller,Law,Novels",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1320434601l/11600163.jpg,1444729705,https://goodreads.com/book/show/11600163-the-litigators,385,3.82,6137,The Litigators,65958

Sarah Murgatroyd,"The harrowing true story of the Burke and Willis expedition team who took on the Australian wilds 150 years ago--and lost.,They departed Melbourne's Royal Park in the summer of 1860, a misfit party of eighteen amateur explorers cheered on by thousands of well-wishers. Their mission: to chart a course across the vast unmapped interior of Australia, from Melbourne to the northern coast. Months later, only one man returned alive--with tales of heroism, hardships, and lost opportunities that were by turns terrifying and darkly comic.,Drawing its title from one of the few remaining traces of the expedition, ,The Dig Tree, combines the danger of Sebastian Junger with the irony of Bill Bryson to relive the tragic journey of these completely initiated adventurers. The cast of characters includes the expeditionleader; a reckless, charming Irish policeman known for getting lost on his way home from the pub; an eccentric nature enthusiast from Germany; an alcoholic camel handler; and a rogue American horse-breaker who is just in it for the money. For nine harrowing months, their quest for glory shifts from idiocy to perseverance and then inexorably toward tragedy. The nightmare culminates in a last haunting message left behind a group of desperate and dying men--the word DIG carved into what is now Australia's most famous tree.,The Dig Tree, follows this compelling journey through a forgotten corner of history to examine a daring expedition that came unbelievably close to success only to let it slip away.","History,Nonfiction,Cultural,Australia,Adventure,Travel,Biography,Historical,Literature,19th Century,Literature,21st Century",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1320514292l/1160131.jpg,767908287,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1160131.The_Dig_Tree,355,4.19,84,"The Dig Tree: The Story of Bravery, Insanity, and the Race to Discover Australia's Wild Frontier",679

Wade Davis,"A magnificent work of history, biography and adventure.,If the quest for Mount Everest began as a grand imperial gesture, as redemption for an empire of explorers that had lost the race to the Poles, it ended as a mission of regeneration for a country and a people bled white by war. Of the twenty-six British climbers who, on three expedtions (1921-24), walked 400 miles off the map to find and assault the highest mountain on Earth, twenty had seen the worst of the fighting. Six had been severely wounded, two others nearly died of disease at the Front, one was hospitalized twice with shell shock. Three as army surgeons dealt for the duration with the agonies of the dying. Two lost brothers, killed in action. All had endured the slaughter, the coughing of the guns, the bones and barbed wire, the white faces of the dead.,In a monumental work of history and adventure, ten years in the writing, Wade Davis asks not whether George Mallory was the first to reach the summit of Everest, but rather why he kept on climbing on that fateful day. His answer lies in a single phrase uttered by one of the survivors as they retreated from the mountain: ""The price of life is death."" Mallory walked on because for him, as for all of his generation, death was but ""a frail barrier that men crossed, smiling and gallant, every day."" As climbers they accepted a degree of risk unimaginable before the war. They were not cavalier, but death was no stranger. They had seen so much of it that it had no hold on them.

Stephen King,"Five interconnected, sequential narratives, set in the years from 1960 to 1999. Each story is deeply rooted in the sixties, and each is haunted by the Vietnam War.,Stephen King, whose first novel, Carrie, was published in 1974, the year before the last U.S. troops withdrew from Vietnam, is the first hugely popular writer of the TV generation. Images from that war -- and the protests against it -- had flooded America's living rooms for a decade. Hearts in Atlantis, King's newest fiction, is composed of five interconnected, sequential narratives, set in the years from 1960 to 1999. Each story is deeply rooted in the sixties, and each is haunted by the Vietnam War. ,In Part One, ""Low Men in Yellow Coats,"" eleven-year-old Bobby Garfield discovers a world of predatory malice in his own neighborhood. He also discovers that adults are sometimes not rescuers but at the heart of the terror. ,In the title story, a bunch of college kids get hooked on a card game, discover the possibility of protest...and confront their own collective heart of darkness, where laughter may be no more than the thinly disguised cry of the beast. ,In ""Blind Willie"" and ""Why We're in Vietnam,"" two men who grew up with Bobby in suburban Connecticut try to fill the emptiness of the post-Vietnam era in an America which sometimes seems as hollow -- and as haunted -- as their own lives. ,And in ""Heavenly Shades of Night Are Falling,"" this remarkable book's denouement, Bobby returns to his hometown where one final secret, the hope of redemption, and his heart's desire may await him. ,Full of danger, full of suspense, most of all full of heart, Stephen King's new book will take some readers to a place they have never been...and others to a place they have never been able to completely leave.","Horror,Fiction,Fantasy,Short Stories,Thriller,Suspense,Fantasy,Supernatural,Mystery,Historical,Historical Fiction,War",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1374048926l/11602.jpg,340818670,https://goodreads.com/book/show/11602.Hearts_in_Atlantis,640,3.83,2339,Hearts in Atlantis,85684

With emphasis on recent developments in space activities, this new edition has been completely revised. Every chapter has been updated and rewritten by an expert engineer in the field, with emphasis on the bus rather than the payload., Encompassing the fundamentals of spacecraft engineering, the book begins with front-end system-level issues, such as environment, mission analysis and system engineering, and progresses to a detailed examination of subsystem elements which represent the core of spacecraft design - mechanical, electrical, propulsion, thermal, control etc. This quantitative treatment is supplemented by an appreciation of the interactions between the elements, which deeply influence the process of spacecraft systems design., In particular the revised text includes, * A new chapter on small satellites engineering and applications which has been contributed by two internationally-recognised experts, with insights into small satellite systems engineering., * Additions to the mission analysis chapter, treating issues of aero-manouevring, constellation design and small body missions., In summary, this is an outstanding textbook for aerospace engineering and design students, and offers essential reading for spacecraft engineers, designers and research scientists.

On a warm autumn night at Longshot Hall, Sir Gifford gets the shock of his life. Horrifically and inexplicably, he witnesses his own murder...,Dennis Yates Wheatley (1897—1977) was an English author whose prolific output of stylish thrillers and occult novels made him one of the world's bestselling writers from the 1930s through the 1960s. His Gregory Sallust series was one of the main inspirations for Ian Fleming's James Bond stories. Born in South London, he was the eldest of three children of an upper-middle-class family, the owners of Wheatley & Son of Mayfair, a wine business. He admitted to little aptitude for schooling, and was expelled from Dulwich College. Soon after his expulsion Wheatley became a British Merchant Navy officer cadet on the training ship HMS Worcester. During the Second World War, Wheatley was a member of the London Controlling Section, which secretly coordinated strategic military deception and cover plans. His literary talents gained him employment with planning staffs for the War Office. He wrote numerous papers for the War Office, including suggestions for dealing with a German invasion of Britain. Dennis Wheatley died on 11th November 1977.

C.J. Moore,"From ""chips"" and ""crumbs"" to ""spending a penny,"" ,The Queen's English, is your indispensable guide to surviving and thriving in the tricky byways of the English language, which has shown many a poor soul the way out for little more than twanging a vowel, splitting an infinitive or, crime of all crimes, saying dinner instead of tea. With ,The Queen's English, there's no need to become ""flummoxed"" ever again. This must-have A to Z guide uncovers the quintessential meanings behind more than 100 familiar words and phrases of the distinctively British lexicon, including:,By hook or by crook (adv. phrase):, It is good to find a phrase in common use that goes back as far as this one, and which appears (though not entirely proven) to link back to England's feudal past. In medieval times when the peasantry were not allowed to cut down trees, they were permitted nonetheless to gather firewood from loose or dead branches which could be obtained using ""hook"" (bill hook, a traditional cutting tool) or ""crook,"" a staff with a curved end. No doubt the desperate peasant often exceeded the strict use of these tools, and so the sense is to achieve something by whatever means possible. The first recorded use of the phrase is from the fourteenth century.,Gazump (vt.):, Usually so proud of their reputation for playing fair, the English have a curious blind spot when it comes to buying and selling houses. To ""gazump"" is to raise the price of a piece of real estate after the sale has been agreed but before the contract is signed, usually on the pretext that the owner has received a higher offer elsewhere. The original buyer is then forced to raise their offer or the property goes to the higher bidder. This unethical but not illegal practice appeared first with the spelling ""gazoomph"" and was derived from an older and more general term ""gazumph"" (or gezumph) for the various kinds of swindling that go on at dishonest auctions.,In a nutshell (adv. phrase):, ""Oh God, I could be bounded in a nutshell and count myself a King of infinite space..."" cries Hamlet in Shakespeare's tragic play. But the meaning of the expression, namely, to put much into a small space, goes way back to classical times, to Pliny's ,Natural History, where he writes: ""Cicero records that a parchment copy of Homer's poem ,The Iliad, was enclosed in a nutshell (,in nuce,)."" In Shakespeare's own time, a Bible is said to have been produced that could fit into a nutshell, and that curiosity may have come to the playwright's notice.,People like us (np.):, Often abbreviated to PLU, this phrase is used by those of a certain social class to approve of others as acceptable by birth and station, and originates in the 1940s milieu typified by the artistic, wayward, and eccentric Mitford sisters, daughters of the second Baron Redesdale. We get a flavor of the attitude where Nancy Mitford, in a letter to her sister Jessica (August 28, 1957), declared that ""People Like Us are never killed in earthquakes ...."" Nancy refined the art of social class distinctions in her book ,Noblesse Oblige, with a list of subtle differences in vocabulary first defined as U (upper class) and non-U (aspriring middle class) by the sociolinguist Alan Ross in 1954.,So if you ever wanted to know what it means to be a ""meat-and-potatoes man,"" a ""lame duck,"" or to be in a ""pretty pickle,"" stop ""umming and erring"" and read this fascinating collection ""straightaway.""","Nonfiction,Reference",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1388340798l/11604975.jpg,1606523252,https://goodreads.com/book/show/11604975-the-queen-s-english,128,3.69,5,The Queen's English: An A to Zed Guide To Distinctively British Words,29
G.K. Chesterton,"The Ballad of the White Horse, is one of the last great epic poems in the English language. On the one hand it describes King Alfred's battle against the Danes in 878. On the other hand it is a timeless allegory about the ongoing battle between Christianity and the forces of nihilistic heathenism. Filled with colorful characters, thrilling battles and mystical visions, it is as lively as it is profound. Chesterton incorporates brilliant imagination, atmosphere, moral concern, chronological continuity, wisdom and fancy. He makes his stanzas reverberate with sound, and hurries his readers into the heart of the battle. This deluxe volume is the definitive edition of the poem. It exactly reproduces the 1928 edition with Robert Austin's beautiful woodcuts, and includes a thorough introduction and wonderful endnotes by Sister Bernadette Sheridan, from her 60 years researching the poem.,""When Chesterton writes poetry, he excels like no other modern writer. The rhyme, rhythm, alliteration and imagery are a complete joy to the ear. But ,The Ballad of the White Horse, is not just a poem. It is a prophecy."" —Dale Ahlquist, President, The American Chesterton Society,""Not only a charming poem and a great tale, this is a keystone work of Christian literature that will be read long after most of the books of our era are forgotten."" —Michael O'Brien, Author, ,Father Elijah","Poetry,Classics,Fiction,Historical,Historical Fiction,Literature,Christianity,Catholic,Christian,Historical,Religion,European Literature,British Literature",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348941939l/1160501.jpg,,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1160501.The_Ballad_of_the_White_Horse,231,4.25,114,The Ballad of the White Horse,1375

"Ingrid Pfeiffer,Max Hollein","Few artists of the late nineteenth century produced an oeuvre more bizarre, ironic, profound and rich in interpretive possibilities than the Belgian painter James Ensor. Ensor lived from 1860 until 1949, and has enjoyed newfound fame since 1994 as the subject of the They Might Be Giants song ""Meet James Ensor."" His unusual work challenged standards of taste and technique by mingling the influence of his Belgian forbears, Bosch and Breugel, with a bright, loosely brushed impressionist style. Ensor offered unmistakable symbols of the absurdity of existence--particularly in portraying the tourists who flooded his native Ostend on their vacations, whom he caricatured mercilessly as clowns and skeletons, or concealed behind brightly colored carnival masks. His painting influenced both German Expressionists and French Surrealists. When seen in the light of new trends towards the grotesque and comic in contemporary painting, his work obtains new currency. ,James Ensor, includes some eighty masterpieces on canvas and sixty works on paper from international museums and private collections, with key pieces from each of his creative periods. Particular attention is paid to his late work, long neglected by scholarship, in order to prepare the ground for a re-evaluation.","Art,Nonfiction",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1181510947l/1160558.jpg,377571703X,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1160558.James_Ensor,331,4.13,1,James Ensor,8

"Peter Verhelst,Sherry Marx","Tonguecat tells the story of a city's decline into chaos and violence upon the arrival of Prometheus, the titan who stole fire from the gods and gave it to mankind. In the Netherlands, the novel has been described as ""a cross between Jorge Luis Borges's mystical labyrinth and William Gibson's futuristic sprawl"" (""The Rights Report""). ,As the novel opens, Prometheus abandons a mythical, primeval world ruled by violence for a cold, earthly city that is perpetually in renewal--a caricature of the city in which we live. ,Once descended, Ulrike, an orphaned girl whose body produces music, guides Prometheus though the slums of the city. Prometheus finds himself in a counterculture of squatters, junkies, and storytelling whores--called tonguecats. The fire of resistance is smoldering all through the city; although the court continues to function, opposition to the monarchy mounts, and the king leaves his palace in search of human warmth. ,Peter Verhelst's story, together with the city, bursts apart at the seams.

Paul Quarrington,"From one of Canada’s beloved fiction writers comes a tale of love and loss, guilt and forgiveness -- and finding redemption in the eye of a hurricane.,Few people seek out the tiny Caribbean island of Dampier Cay. Visitors usually wash up there by accident, rather than by design. But this weekend, three people will fly to the island deliberately. They are not coming for a tan or fun in the sun. They are coming because Dampier Cay is where it is, and they have reason to believe that they might encounter something there that most people take great measures to avoid -- a hurricane.,A lottery windfall and a few hours of selfishness have robbed Caldwell of all that was precious to him, while Beverly, haunted by tragedy and screwed by fate since birth, has given up on life. Also on the flight is Jimmy Newton, a professional storm chaser and videographer who will do anything for the perfect shot.

Most are loathe to admit that the United States has any imperial pretensions. But history tells a different story as filmmaker Oliver Stone and historian Peter Kuznick reveal in this riveting account of the rise and decline of the American empire.,Aided by the latest archival findings and recently declassified documents and building on the research of the world’s best scholars, Stone and Kuznick construct an often shocking but meticulously documented “People’s History of the American Empire” that offers startling context to the Bush-Cheney policies that put us at war in two Muslim countries and show us why the Obama administration has had such a difficult time cleaving a new path.,Stone and Kuznick will introduce readers to a pantheon of heroes and villains as they show not only how far the United States has drifted from its democratic traditions, but the powerful forces that have struggled to get us back on track.,The authors reveal that:,· The atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki were militarily unnecessary and morally indefensible.,· The United States, not the Soviet Union, bore the lion’s share of responsibility for perpetuating the Cold War.,· The U.S. love affair with right-wing dictators has gone as far as overthrowing elected leaders, arming and training murderous military officers, and forcing millions of people into poverty.,· U.S.-funded Islamist fundamentalists, who fought against the Soviets in Afghanistan, have blown back to threaten the interests of the U.S. and its allies.,· U.S. presidents, especially in wartime, have frequently trampled on the constitution and international law.,· The United States has brandished nuclear threats repeatedly and come terrifyingly close to nuclear war.,American leaders often believe they are unbound by history, yet Stone and Kuznick argue that we must face our troubling history honestly and forthrightly in order to set a new course for the twenty-first century.

Edward G. Lengel,"Much has been written in the past two centuries about George Washington the statesman and “father of his country.” Less often discussed is Washington’s military career, including his exploits as a young officer and his performance as the Revolutionary War commander in chief. Now, in a revealing work of historical biography, Edward Lengel has written the definitive account of George Washington the soldier.,Based largely on Washington’s personal papers, this engrossing book paints a vivid, factual portrait of a man to whom lore and legend so tenaciously cling. To Lengel, Washington was the imperfect commander. Washington possessed no great tactical ingenuity, and his acknowledged “brilliance in retreat” only demonstrates the role luck plays in the fortunes of all great men. He was not an enlisted man’s leader; he made a point of never mingling with his troops. He was not an especially creative military thinker; he fought largely by the book. ,He was not a professional, but a citizen soldier, who, at a time when warfare demanded that armies maneuver efficiently in precise formation, had little practical training handling men in combat. Yet despite his flaws, Washington was a remarkable figure, a true man of the moment, a leader who possessed a clear strategic, national, and continental vision, and who inspired complete loyalty from his fellow revolutionaries, officers, and enlisted men. America could never have won freedom without him.,A trained surveyor, Washington mastered topography and used his superior knowledge of battlegrounds to maximum effect. He appreciated the importance of good allies in times of crisis, and understood well the benefits of coordination of ground and naval forces. Like the American nation itself, he was a whole that was greater than the sum of its parts–a remarkable everyman whose acts determined the course of history. Lengel argues that Washington’s excellence was in his completeness, in how he united the military, political, and personal skills necessary to lead a nation in war and peace. ,At once informative and engaging, and filled with some eye-opening revelations about Washington, the war for American independence, and the very nature of military command, General George Washington is a book that reintroduces readers to a figure many think they already know.,From the Hardcover edition.","History,Biography,Nonfiction,North American Hi...,American History,Military,Military History,Audiobook,Military History,American Revolution,War,Military Fiction,American Revolution,American Revolutionary War,Politics,Presidents",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1510671361l/1161002._SX318_.jpg,1400060818,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1161002.General_George_Washington,450,4.07,27,General George Washington: A Military Life,364
Edward G. Lengel,"The authoritative, dramatic, and previously untold story of the bloodiest battle in American history: the epic fight for the Meuse-Argonne in World War I, ,On September 26, 1918, more than one million American soldiers prepared to assault the German-held Meuse-Argonne region of France. Their commander, General John J. Pershing, believed in the superiority of American ""guts"" over barbed wire, machine guns, massed artillery, and poison gas. In thirty-six hours, he said, the Doughboys would crack the German defenses and open the road to Berlin. Six weeks later, after savage fighting across swamps, forests, towns, and rugged hills, the battle finally ended with the signing of the armistice that concluded the First World War. The Meuse-Argonne had fallen, at the cost of more than 120,000 American casualties, including 26,000 dead. In the bloodiest battle the country had ever seen, an entire generation of young Americans had been transformed forever. ,To Conquer Hell ,is gripping in its accounts of combat, studded with portraits of remarkable soldiers like Pershing, Harry Truman, George Patton, and Alvin York, and authoritative in presenting the big picture.

The majority—about 140,000 documents—are from his years as commander in chief during the Revolutionary War, from 1775 to 1783. ,This Glorious Struggle, presents a selection of Washington's most important and interesting letters from that time, including many that have never been published.,Washington's lively and often surprisingly candid notes to his wife and family, friends, Congress, fellow soldiers—and even the enemy—chronicle his most critical tactical and strategic decisions, while offering a rare glimpse of the extremes of depression and exultation into which he was cast by the fortunes of war. The letters are arranged chronologically and give a dramatic sense of the major phases of the war, from Boston, Trenton, and Valley Forge, to Monmouth and Yorktown.,The more personal missives show us a Washington who worried about his wife's well-being and who appreciated a good joke and a well-laid table, not to mention the company of the ladies.,This Glorious Struggle, brings Washington to vivid life, offering a fresh and intimate sense of this most towering American figure and the critical role he played in the creation of our country.","History,Military History,American Revolution,Historical,Nonfiction,Politics,Presidents",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1347514545l/1161008.jpg,61251313,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1161008.This_Glorious_Struggle,320,3.98,11,This Glorious Struggle: George Washington's Revolutionary War Letters,45

Patricia Jones,"Like a glass of lemonade that is both sweet and tart, writer Patricia Jones mixes up a refreshing blend of deep emotion and raw truth, tempered by a grounded dose of wisdom.,To Lila Giles, the term ""passing"" refers to those pale-hued folks who take advantage of their creamy shade by crossing into the white world. Descended from a long line of an elite Baltimore family awash with ""high-colored"" skin just right for ""passing"", family lore told Lila that not one of them would have thought to deny their true selves and rich history in such a way. It is this sense of pride that bonds the Giles family together -- a bond strongly enforced by Lila's controlling stepmother Eulelie. But the delicate balance of this branch of the family Eulelie has so carefully engineered is threatened when Lila's brother decides to marry a woman from an oh-so-very-wrong family.,A proud though severe matriarch, Eulelie Giles has ruled her four grown stepchildren with a heavy self-righteousness that could break the spirit of the most sound opponent, let alone the nearly thirty-year-old Lila. Relentlessly loyal to her privileged world, Eulelie has ingrained upon Lila and her three other stepchildren the importance of distinguishing between acceptable and unacceptable blacks. Despite her strident belief in an unyielding class line, Eulelie has kept a secret about her own past that manages to affect, in more ways than a few, anyone who enters her life. As the wedding day draws closer, Lila begins to look at her reality versus Eulelie's, and what Lila finds leads to a confrontation between stepmother and stepdaughter that could finally shatter Eulelie's reign over Lila and the family, but ultimately, one that will lead Eulelie back to the truth.,Filled with multi-dimensional characters and rich with atmosphere, ,Passing, is a story of tangled family relationships; the secrets, misunderstanding, and deceptions that hold them together.","Fiction,Cultural,African American,Womens",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1181514324l/1161026.jpg,380805855,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1161026.Passing,384,3.86,9,Passing,99
"Jeanne Walker Harvey,Elizabeth Zunon","As a young boy growing up in North Carolina, Romare Bearden listened to his great-grandmother’s Cherokee stories and heard the whistle of the train that took his people to the North—people who wanted to be free. When Romare boarded that same train, he watched out the window as the world whizzed by. Later he captured those scenes in a famous painting, ,Watching the Good Trains Go By,. Using that painting as inspiration and creating a text influenced by the jazz that Bearden loved, Jeanne Walker Harvey describes the patchwork of daily southern life that Romare saw out the train’s window and the story of his arrival in shimmering New York City. Artists and critics today praise Bearden’s collages for their visual metaphors honoring his past, African American culture, and the human experience. Elizabeth Zunon’s illustrations of painted scenes blended with collage are a stirring tribute to a remarkable artist.,My Hands Sing the Blues, is the recipient of the 2012 IRA Childrens and Young Adults Book Award-Primary Non-Fiction, as well as the gold winner of a Moonbeam Children’s Book Award in the category of Picture Book-All Ages.","Art,Childrens,Picture Books,Biography,Childrens,Cultural,African American,Nonfiction,History,Cultural,Music,New York",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1355028160l/11610607.jpg,761458107,https://goodreads.com/book/show/11610607-my-hands-sing-the-blues,40,4.06,33,My Hands Sing the Blues: Romare Bearden's Childhood Journey,136

"Yaeko S. Habein,Gerald B. Mathias","There are many things that make learning to read Japanese difficult, and all of them have to do with kanji. It has been suggested that kanji be banned from use, which might prove awkward considering that they have been a part of the language for over a 1,400 years. It has also been suggested that they be simplified, and a half-hearted attempt was actually made to do just that. But, in the end, the student has only one recourse-which is, to learn them.,Of the many difficulties presented by kanji, this book takes up one: the fact that many of them look so very much alike. In your early years as a student, you may think that what you see before you is the simple character for big, only to be told that, sorry, that's its look-alike, dog. Later on in your career, you see what you believe to be the recently learned rope, only to be told that it is its kissing cousin steel. Years later, with a great deal of experience under your belt, you are still caught flat-footed when you mistake samurai for wait.,This book helps the student to overcome this problem of kissing cousins and spitting images, to become aware of the subtle differences that distinguish one kanji from another. With numerous exercises and charts, the tell-tale signs that give each kanji away are indelibly imprinted on the mind.","Reference,Nonfiction",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1181515558l/1161130._SX318_.jpg,4770024983,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1161130.Decoding_Kanji,144,3.44,0,Decoding Kanji: A Practical Approach to Learning Look-Alike Characters,9

Paul A. Gilje,"Through careful research and colorful accounts, historian Paul A. Gilje discovers what liberty meant to an important group of common men in American society, those who lived and worked on the waterfront and aboard ships. In the process he reveals that the idealized vision of liberty associated with the Founding Fathers had a much more immediate and complex meaning than previously thought.,In ,Liberty on the Waterfront: American Maritime Culture in the Age of Revolution,, life aboard warships, merchantmen, and whalers, as well as the interactions of mariners and others on shore, is recreated in absorbing detail. Describing the important contributions of sailors to the resistance movement against Great Britain and their experiences during the Revolutionary War, Gilje demonstrates that, while sailors recognized the ideals of the Revolution, their idea of liberty was far more individual in nature--often expressed through hard drinking and womanizing or joining a ship of their choice.,Gilje continues the story into the post-Revolutionary world highlighted by the Quasi War with France, the confrontation with the Barbary Pirates, and the War of 1812.","History,North American Hi...,American History,Adventure,Maritime",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1349107081l/1161140.jpg,812219937,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1161140.Liberty_on_the_Waterfront,344,3.79,2,Liberty on the Waterfront: American Maritime Culture in the Age of Revolution,34

"Bruce Bueno de Mesquita,Alastair      Smith","For eighteen years, Bruce Bueno de Mesquita and Alastair Smith have been part of a team revolutionizing the study of politics by turning conventional wisdom on its head. They start from a single assertion: Leaders do whatever keeps them in power. They don’t care about the “national interest”—or even their subjects—unless they have to. This clever and accessible book shows that the difference between tyrants and democrats is just a convenient fiction. Governments do not differ in kind but only in the number of essential supporters, or backs that need scratching. The size of this group determines almost everything about politics: what leaders can get away with, and the quality of life or misery under them. The picture the authors paint is not pretty.

Few people in the West know anything about Iranian people beyond their current politics and religion. In this book, award-winning travel writer Jill Worrall, with her friend Reza Mirkhalaf, a leading tour manager from Tehran, describe an Iran the world has forgotten about. Using the threads of Iran's silk road heritage as a basis for a road trip travelogue, they visit places both ancient and modern, many rarely written about by westerners. Jill's vivid observations are complemented by Reza's expert knowledge of Iran's history, religion, culture and architecture.,During their journey, Jill and Reza explore the caravanserai that were once a vital part of the silk routes that once crossed Persia, while also encountering many ordinary Iranians. The result is a picture of Iran that offers a detailed insight into the landscapes, landmarks and people of the country at a grassroots level.

"John S. McCormick,John R. Sillito","Utah, now one of the most conservative states, has a long tradition of left-wing radicalism. Early Mormon settlers set a precedent with the United Order and other experiments with a socialistic economy. The tradition continued into the more recent past with New Left, anti-apartheid, and other radicals. Throughout, Utah radicalism usually reflected national and international developments. Recounting its long history, McCormick and Sillito focus especially on the Socialist Party of America, which reached a peak of political influence in the first two decades of the twentieth century—in Utah and across the nation. ,At least 115 Socialists in over two dozen Utah towns and cities were elected to office in that period, and on seven occasions they controlled governments, of five different municipalities. This is a little-known story worth a closer look. Histories of Socialism in the United States have tended to forsake attention to details, to specific, local cases and situations, in favor of broader overviews of the movement. By looking closely at Utah's experience, this book helps unravel how American Socialism briefly flowered and rapidly withered in the early twentieth century. It also broadens conventional understanding of Utah history.",,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1328773372l/11615185.jpg,874218144,https://goodreads.com/book/show/11615185-history-of-utah-radicalism,456,3.73,1,"History of Utah Radicalism: Startling, Socialistic, and Decidedly Revolutionary",11

Piers Anthony,"Macroscope Throughout history, man has been searching for better ways to gather information about his universe. But although they may have longed for it, not even the most brilliant minds could conceive of a device as infinitely powerful or as immeasurably precise as the macroscope, until the twenty-first century. By analyzing information carried on macrons, this unbelievable tool brought the whole universe of wonders to man's doorstep. The macroscope was seen by many as the salvation of the human race. But in the hands of the wrong man, the macroscope could be immensely destructive-infinitely more dangerous than the nuclear bomb. By searching to know too much, man could destroy the very essence of his mind. This is the powerful story of man's struggle with technology, and also the story of his human struggle with himself. This novel takes us across the breathtaking ranges of space as well as through the most touching places in the human heart. It is a story of coming of age, of sacrifice, and of love.

Nadine Cohodas,"Muddy Waters. Howlin' Wolf. Chuck Berry. Etta James. Bo Diddley.,The greatest artists who sang the blues made their mark with Leonard and Phil Chess, whose Chess Records was synonymous with the sound that swept up from the south, embraced Chicago and spread out into mid-century America. ,Spinning Blues into Gold, is the impeccably researched story of the men behind the music and the remarkable company they created. Chess Records-and later Checkers, Argo and Cadet-was built by Polish immigrant Jews, brothers who saw the blues as a unique business opportunity. From their first ventures, a liquor store and then a nightclub, they promoted live entertainment. And parlayed that into the first pressings sold out of car trunks on long junkets through the midsection of the country, ultimately expanding their empire to include influential radio stations. The story of the Chess brothers is a very American story of commerce in the service of culture. Long on chutzpah, Leonard and Phil went far beyond their childhoods as the sons of a scrap-metal dealer. They changed what America listened to; the artists they promoted planted the seeds of rock 'n' roll and are still influencing music today.,The story of the Chess brothers and the music they made captures the rich and volatile mix of race, Jews and music. Cohodas takes us deep into the world of independent record producers, sometimes abrasive and always aggressive men striving to succeed. Leonard and Phil worked hand-in-glove with disenfranchised black artists, the intermittent charges of exploitation balanced by the reality of a common purpose that brought them fame. From beginning to end, the lives of the Chesses were entwined with those of the artists socially, financially and creatively.","Music,History,Cultural,African American,Biography",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1311980155l/1161633.jpg,312261330,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1161633.Spinning_Blues_into_Gold,358,4.01,15,Spinning Blues into Gold: The Chess Brothers and the Legendary Chess Records,120

John F. MacArthur Jr.,"The charismatic movement of the past quarter-century has made an impact on the church unparalleled in history. But one legacy of the movement is confusion and mushy thinking. In Charismatic Chaos, John F. MacArthur calls for biblical evaluation and analyzes the doctrinal differences between charismatics and non-charismatics in the light of Scripture. ""My principal concern,"" writes John MacArthur, ""is to call the church to a firm commitment to the purity and authority of the Scriptures, and thereby to strengthen the unity of the true church."" To tough questions that seem to divide, Charismatic Chaos provides tougher answers that strive to unite. This book tackles such questions as - Is experience a valid test of truth? - Does God still give revelation? - Prophets, fanatics, or heretics? - Does God still heal? - What should we think of the Signs and Wonders movement? - Does the Bible promise health and wealth?","Religion,Theology,Nonfiction,Religion,Christianity,Religion,Christian,Christian Living,Christian,Christian Non Fiction,Spirituality,Religion,Church,Religion,Faith",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348391547l/116165.jpg,310575729,https://goodreads.com/book/show/116165.Charismatic_Chaos,416,4.01,76,Charismatic Chaos,1044

"Judith Farr,Louise Carter","In this first substantial study of Emily Dickinson's devotion to flowers and gardening, Judith Farr seeks to join both poet and gardener in one creative personality. She casts new light on Dickinson's temperament, her aesthetic sensibility, and her vision of the relationship between art and nature, revealing that the successful gardener's intimate understanding of horticulture helped shape the poet's choice of metaphors for every experience: love and hate, wickedness and virtue, death and immortality.,Gardening, Farr demonstrates, was Dickinson's other vocation, more public than the making of poems but analogous and closely related to it. Over a third of Dickinson's poems and nearly half of her letters allude with passionate intensity to her favorite wildflowers, to traditional blooms like the daisy or gentian, and to the exotic gardenias and jasmines of her conservatory. Each flower was assigned specific connotations by the nineteenth century floral dictionaries she knew; thus, Dickinson's association of various flowers with friends, family, and lovers, like the tropes and scenarios presented in her poems, establishes her participation in the literary and painterly culture of her day. A chapter, ""Gardening with Emily Dickinson"" by Louise Carter, cites family letters and memoirs to conjecture the kinds of flowers contained in the poet's indoor and outdoor gardens. Carter hypothesizes Dickinson's methods of gardening, explaining how one might grow her flowers today.,Beautifully illustrated and written with verve, ""The Gardens of Emily Dickinson"" will provide pleasure and insight to a wide audience of scholars, admirers of Dickinson's poetry, and garden lovers everywhere.","Nonfiction,Poetry,Biography,Gardening,History,Environment,Nature,Art,Literature,American",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348821447l/11616.jpg,067401829X,https://goodreads.com/book/show/11616.The_Gardens_of_Emily_Dickinson,350,3.85,15,The Gardens of Emily Dickinson,66
Oyèrónkẹ́ Oyěwùmí,"The OC woman question, OCO this book asserts, is a Western one, and not a proper lens for viewing African society. A work that rethinks gender as a Western construction, The Invention of Women offers a new way of understanding both Yoruban and Western cultures. Author Oyeronke Oyewumi reveals an ideology of biological determinism at the heart of Western social categories-the idea that biology provides the rationale for organizing the social world. And yet, she writes, the concept of OC woman, OCO central to this ideology and to Western gender discourses, simply did not exist in Yorubaland, where the body was not the basis of social roles. Oyewumi traces the misapplication of Western, body-oriented concepts of gender through the history of gender discourses in Yoruba studies. Her analysis shows the paradoxical nature of two fundamental assumptions of feminist theory: that gender is socially constructed and that the subordination of women is universal. The Invention of Women demonstrates, to the contrary, that gender was not constructed in old Yoruba society, and that social organization was determined by relative age. A meticulous historical and epistemological account of an African culture on its own terms, this book makes a persuasive argument for a cultural, context-dependent interpretation of social reality. It calls for a reconception of gender discourse and the categories on which such study relies. More than that, the book lays bare the hidden assumptions in the ways these different cultures think. A truly comparative sociology of an African culture and the Western tradition, it will change the way African studies and gender studies proceed.

When you flick on your light switch the light goes on--how? When you put out your garbage, where does it go? When you flush your toilet, what happens to the waste? How does water get from a reservoir in the mountains to your city faucet? How do flowers get to your corner store from Holland, or bananas get there from Ecuador? Who is operating the traffic lights all over the city? And what in the world is that steam coming out from underneath the potholes on the street? Across the city lies a series of extraordinarily complex and interconnected systems. Often invisible, and wholly taken for granted, these are the systems that make urban life possible. , ,The Works: Anatomy of a City, offers a cross section of this hidden infrastructure, using beautiful, innovative graphic images combined with short, clear text explanations to answer all the questions about the way things work in a modern city. It describes the technologies that keep the city functioning, as well as the people who support them-the pilots that bring the ships in over the Narrows sandbar, the sandhogs who are currently digging the third water tunnel under Manhattan, the television engineer who scales the Empire State Building's antenna for routine maintenance, the electrical wizards who maintain the century-old system that delivers power to subways. , Did you know that the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge is so long, and its towers are so high, that the builders had to take the curvature of the earth's surface into account when designing it? Did you know that the George Washington Bridge takes in approximately $1 million per day in tolls? Did you know that retired subway cars travel by barge to the mid-Atlantic, where they are dumped overboard to form natural reefs for fish? Or that if the telecom cables under New York were strung end to end, they would reach from the earth to the sun? While the book uses New York as its example, it has relevance well beyond that city's boundaries as the systems that make New York a functioning metropolis are similar to those that keep the bright lights burning in big cities everywhere. , ,The Works, is for anyone who has ever stopped midcrosswalk, looked at the rapidly moving metropolis around them, and wondered, how does this all work?","Nonfiction,Architecture,Geography,Cities,Cities,Urban Planning,New York,Science,Design,Cities,Urban Studies,Reference,Cities,Urbanism",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1309209282l/116170.jpg,1594200718,https://goodreads.com/book/show/116170.The_Works,240,4.1,143,The Works: Anatomy of a City,1406
Anthony Arthur,"He was only a Dutch tailor's apprentice, but from 1534 to 1535, Jan van Leyden led a radical sect of persecuted Anabaptists to repeated triumphs over the combined powers of church and state. Revered by his followers as the new David, the charismatic young leader pronounced the northern German city of Muenster a new Zion and crowned himself king. He expropriated all private property, took sixteen wives (supposedly emulating the biblical patriarchs), and in a deadly reign of terror, executed all who opposed him. As the long siege of Muenster resulted in starvation, thousands fled Jan's deadly kingdom while others waited behind the double walls and moats for the apocalyptic final attack by the Prince-Bishop's hired armies, supported by all the rulers of Europe.,With the sudden rise to power of a compelling personality and the resulting violent threat to ordered society, Jan van Leyden's distant story strangely echoes the many tragedies of the twentieth century. More than just a fascinating human drama from the past, ,The Tailor-King, also offers insight into our own troubled times.","History,Religion,Nonfiction,Cultural,Germany,History,European History,Religion,Christianity,Church,Church History",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1311986002l/1161742.jpg,312267835,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1161742.The_Tailor_King,256,4.32,22,The Tailor-King: The Rise and Fall of the Anabaptist Kingdom of Muenster,202

Marcia Bjornerud,"To many of us, the Earth's crust is a relic of ancient, unknowable history. But to a geologist, stones are richly illustrated narratives, telling gothic tales of cataclysm and reincarnation. For more than four billion years, in beach sand, granite, and garnet schists, the planet has kept a rich and idiosyncratic journal of its past.

Jim Sullivan,"Bringing to mind the exploits of Pappy Boyington and his Blacksheep Squadron and Tommy Blackburn with the Jolly Rogers, the Corsair is among the most formidable U.S. fighters of World War II. The F4U maintained a kill ratio of 11:1 according to the United States Navy and went on to serve American forces in Korea, holding its own in the early years of the jet age. The Corsair was first conceived as a high-speed, high-altitude fighter for the Navy in 1938 when Chance Vought?s design team drew up plans for a fighter with a 1,800 h.p. engine and a huge 13-foot propeller. The Corsair?s famous inverted gull wing design was introduced to allow prop clearance. Handling problems delayed the aircraft?s deployment aboard carriers, but Marine Corps pilots quickly took to the powerful, rugged fighter and VMF-124, the first Marine squadron to fly the Corsair in combat, also produced the first Corsair air ace, Kenneth A. Walsh, by the summer of 1943. A total of 12,571 Corsairs were built between 1940 and 1952, most of them by Vought, but hundreds by Goodyear and Brewster as those companies? assembly lines had to be pressed into service to meet soaring demand for the remarkable aircraft.

Terry Alford,"With a single shot from a pistol small enough to conceal in his hand, John Wilkes Booth catapulted into history on the night of April 14, 1865. The assassination of President Abraham Lincoln stunned a nation that was just emerging from the chaos and calamity of the Civil War, and the president's untimely death altered the trajectory of postwar history. But to those who knew Booth, the event was even more shocking-for no one could have imagined that this fantastically gifted actor and well-liked man could commit such an atrocity. ,In Fortune's Fool, Terry Alford provides the first comprehensive look at the life of an enigmatic figure whose life has been overshadowed by his final, infamous act. Tracing Booth's story from his uncertain childhood in Maryland, characterized by a difficult relationship with his famous actor father, to his successful acting career on stages across the country, Alford offers a nuanced picture of Booth as a public figure, performer, and deeply troubled man. Despite the fame and success that attended Booth's career--he was billed at one point as ""the youngest star in the world""--he found himself consumed by the Confederate cause and the desire to help the South win its independence. Alford reveals the tormented path that led Booth to conclude, as the Confederacy collapsed in April 1865, that the only way to revive the South and punish the North for the war would be to murder Lincoln--whatever the cost to himself or others. The textured and compelling narrative gives new depth to the familiar events at Ford's Theatre and the aftermath that followed, culminating in Booth's capture and death at the hands of Union soldiers 150 years ago. ,Based on original research into government archives, historical libraries, and family records, Fortune's Fool offers the definitive portrait of John Wilkes Booth.","Biography,History,Military History,Civil War,Nonfiction,North American Hi...,American History,American History,American Civil War,Anthologies,Collections,Biography Memoir,Literature,19th Century,Crime,True Crime",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1417982237l/1162008.jpg,195054121,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1162008.Fortune_s_Fool,464,4.12,40,Fortune's Fool: The Life of John Wilkes Booth,167

Larry W. Hurtado,"This outstanding book provides an in-depth historical study of the place of Jesus in the religious life, beliefs, and worship of Christians from the beginnings of the Christian movement down to the late second century.,Lord Jesus Christ, is a monumental work on earliest Christian devotion to Jesus, sure to replace Wilhelm Bousset’s ,Kyrios Christos, (1913) as the standard work on the subject. Larry Hurtado, widely respected for his previous contributions to the study of the New Testament and Christian origins, offers the best view to date of how the first Christians saw and reverenced Jesus as divine. In assembling this compelling picture, Hurtado draws on a wide body of ancient sources, from Scripture and the writings of such figures as Ignatius of Antioch and Justin to apocryphal texts such as the ,Gospel of Thomas, and the ,Gospel of Truth., Hurtado considers such themes as early beliefs about Jesus’ divine status and significance, but he also explores telling devotional practices of the time, including prayer and worship, the use of Jesus’ name in exorcism, baptism and healing, ritual invocation of Jesus as “Lord,” martyrdom, and lesser-known phenomena such as prayer postures and the curious scribal practice known today as the ,nomina sacra., The revealing portrait that emerges from Hurtado’s comprehensive study yields definitive answers to questions like these: How important was this formative period to later Christian tradition? When did the divinization of Jesus first occur? Was early Christianity influenced by neighboring religions? How did the idea of Jesus’ divinity change old views of God? And why did the powerful dynamics of early beliefs and practices encourage people to make the costly move of becoming a Christian? , Boasting an unprecedented breadth and depth of coverage — the book speaks authoritatively on everything from early Christian history to themes in biblical studies to New Testament Christology — Hurtado’s ,Lord Jesus Christ, is at once significant enough that a wide range of scholars will want to read it and accessible enough that general readers interested at all in Christian origins will also profit greatly from it.","Religion,Theology,Religion,Christianity,Religion,History,Christianity,New Testament,Church,Church History,Reference,Christian",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1347597246l/1162335.jpg,802831672,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1162335.Lord_Jesus_Christ,768,4.51,11,Lord Jesus Christ: Devotion to Jesus in Earliest Christianity,113

Forrest Carter,"The Education of Little Tree tells of a boy orphaned very young, who is adopted by his Cherokee grandmother and half-Cherokee grandfather in the Appalachian mountains of Tennessee during the Great Depression. Little Tree as his grandparents call him is shown how to hunt and survive in the mountains, to respect nature in the Cherokee Way, taking only what is needed, leaving the rest for nature to run its course. Little Tree also learns the often callous ways of white businessmen and tax collectors, and how Granpa, in hilarious vignettes, scares them away from his illegal attempts to enter the cash economy. Granma teaches Little Tree the joys of reading and education. But when Little Tree is taken away by whites for schooling, we learn of the cruelty meted out to Indian children in an attempt to assimilate them and of Little Tree's perception of the Anglo world and how it differs from the Cherokee Way. A classic of its era, and an enduring book for all ages, The Education of Little Tree has now been redesigned for this twenty-fifth anniversary edition.","Fiction,Historical,Historical Fiction,Young Adult,Classics,Childrens,Young Adult,Coming Of Age,Literature,American,Book Club,Education,Historical",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348789987l/116236.jpg,826328091,https://goodreads.com/book/show/116236.The_Education_of_Little_Tree,228,4.12,1672,The Education of Little Tree,15006

In her frank and thoughtful analysis of what makes and breaks friendships, she explores what it means to have friends or be a friend - even a friend to oneself; what happens when times are tough and friends are scarce; whether one can be a 'good friend' without effort; and what other kinds of friendships there are, whether imaginary, animal or inanimate.

And what better place to escape our wired world than the far northwestern corner of Canadas Northwest Territories and a river that flows through uninhabited country, 400 miles to the Arctic Ocean. But what if your canoeing partner brings along a satellite phone to use in case of an emergency? And, struck by the novelty of anywhere-on-earth communication, he proceeds to use the phone to check in with his law office, his wife, kids, sisters, father, and friends? Noted wilderness traveler and author Ted Kerasote deals with just such a situation as he journeys along the Horton River through the largest ice-free, roadless area left on Earth, a stunning wilderness of grizzly bears, caribou, and migrating birds. Between navigating rapids, slipping around musk ox and grizzlies, and being pinned down by Arctic storms, the two friends prod each other into a finer understanding of love, marriage, parenting, and the meaning of solitude in an increasingly wired world. Contrasting his own experiences with those of the regions earliest explorers--Sir John Franklin and Vilhjalmur Stefansson--Kerasote provides a compelling and humorous take on how travelers from any age adjust to being away from their civilizations and how getting ""out there"" has inevitably changed but has also remained the same--especially if you shut off the phone.","Nature,Outdoors,Nonfiction,Adventure,Outdoors,Wilderness,Environment,Nature",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1328862884l/1162549.jpg,896585565,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1162549.Out_There,160,3.87,19,Out There,122

After reluctantly leaving his family in Boston, Waterhouse arrives in England and is almost killed by a mysterious Infernal Device.

But this major new anthology is the first broad and inclusive selection of the most important work in this field.There are many unanswered questions about the future of feminist philosophy. Which of the many varieties of feminist philosophy will last, and which will fade away? What kinds of accommodations will be possible with mainstream non-feminist philosophy? Which will separate themselves and flourish on their own? To what extent will feminists change the topics philosophers address? To what extent will they change the very way in which philosophy is done?However these questions are answered, it is clear that feminist philosophy is having and will continue to have a major impact on the discipline of philosophy. This volume is the first to allow the scholar, the student, and other interested readers to sample this diverse literature and to ponder these questions for themselves.Organized around nine traditional “types” of feminist philosophy, ,Feminism and Philosophy, is an imaginatively edited volume that will stimulate readers to explore many new pathways to understanding.

Billy Bragg,"What does it mean to be English? What does it mean to be British? Is the cross of St. George a proud symbol of a great tradition, or the badge of a neo-Nazi? In a world where British citizens can lay bombs to kill their countrymen, where religious fundamentalism is on the increase, and where the BNP are somehow part of the democratic process, what does patriotism actually mean? Identity can change depending on what company a person are in. For example, someone could describe themselves British to one person, Scottish to another and, say, a Londoner to another, and be right every time. But problems arise when someone tries to tell you what you are, based on your skin tone, religion, accent, surname, or whatever. This book is Billy Bragg's urgent, eloquent, and passionate response to the events of July 7, 2005, when four bombs tore through a busy morning in London, killing 52 innocent people and injuring many more. A firm believer in tolerance and diversity, he felt himself hemmed in by fascists on one side and religious fanatics on the other. The suicide bombers were all British-born and well integrated into our multicultural society. Yet, they felt no compunction in murdering and maiming their fellow citizens. Inclusivity is important, but without a sense of belonging to accompany it, what chance social cohesion? But where does a sense of belonging come from? Can it be conferred by a legal document? Is it a matter of blood and soil? Can it be taught? Is it nature or nurture? This book pulls no punches in its insights, and its radical vision offers a positive hope for a country teetering on the brink of catastrophe.","Politics,Nonfiction,Biography,Music,History,Autobiography,Memoir",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1181528057l/1163024._SY475_.jpg,593053435,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1163024.The_Progressive_Patriot,289,3.69,40,The Progressive Patriot,310

Luke Timothy Johnson,"As ancient literature and a cornerstone of the Christian faith, the New Testament has exerted a powerful religious and cultural impact. But how much do we really know about its origins? Who were the people who actually wrote the sacred texts that became part of the Christian Bible? ,The New, ,Testament: A Very Short Introduction, authoritatively addresses these questions, offering a fresh perspective on the underpinnings of this profoundly influential collection of writings. , In this concise, engaging book, noted New Testament scholar Luke Timothy Johnson takes readers on a journey back to the time of the early Roman Empire, when the New Testament was written in ordinary Greek (,koine,) by the first Christians. The author explains how the Gospels, Acts of the Apostles, and Revelation evolved into the canon of sacred writings for the Christian religion, and how they reflect a reinterpretation of the symbolic world and societal forces of first-century Greco-Roman and Jewish life. Equally important, readers will find both a positive and critical reading of the New Testament--one that looks beyond its theological orientation to reveal an often-surprising diversity of viewpoints. This one-of-a-kind introduction engages four distinct dimensions of the earliest Christian writings--anthropological, historical, religious, and literary--to provide readers with a broad conceptual and factual framework. In addition, the book takes an in-depth look at compositions that have proven to be particularly relevant over the centuries, including Paul's letters to the Corinthians and Romans and the Gospels of John, Mark, Matthew, and Luke., Ideal for general readers and students alike, this fascinating resource characterizes the writing of the New Testament not as an unknowable abstraction or the product of divine intervention, but as an act of human creativity by people whose real experiences, convictions, and narratives shaped modern Christianity.","Religion,Nonfiction,Religion,Theology,History,Christian,Philosophy,Christianity,New Testament,Religion,Christianity,Academic,School",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1536217906l/11630809.jpg,,https://goodreads.com/book/show/11630809-the-new-testament,160,3.88,13,The New Testament: A Very Short Introduction,168

Kurt Schnaubelt,"Explores science’s new biological understanding of essential oils for improved immunity and treatment of degenerative diseases , ,• Explains how essential oils convey the complex natural healing powers of plants, offering scientifically proven advantages over synthetic drugs , ,• Offers revolutionary essential oil treatments to ameliorate the side effects of chemotherapy and other cancer treatments as well as for hepatitis, osteoporosis, liver detoxification, and the prevention of UV damage and melanoma , ,• Presents simple recipes and protocols for strengthening the immune system; for treatment of common ailments, such as colds, flu, herpes, and candida; and for pain management , ,Exploring science’s new biological understanding of essential oils and their advantages over synthetic drugs, renowned aromatherapist Kurt Schnaubelt reveals how the effectiveness of essential oil treatments stems from our common biochemical and cellular heritage with plants. He explains how essential oils preserve a plant’s complex natural life-supporting and immune-building qualities, developed through millions of years of interaction with animals and humans. Reviewing recent research in molecular, cellular, and evolutionary biology, he shows how the multilayered activity of plant essences helps maintain the integrity of our genetic code--the reason why pathogens cannot develop resistance toward essential oils as they do with antibiotics and antivirals--making essential oils a more effective and sustainable form of treatment for a variety of health problems. , ,Laying to rest old arguments over essential oils’ alleged toxicity and whether they can be ingested or used undiluted, Schnaubelt presents simple recipes and protocols for treating and preventing common ailments, such as colds, flu, herpes, and candida, as well as for pain management. Offering new essential oil treatment opportunities for hepatitis, osteoporosis, liver detoxification, and the prevention of UV damage and melanoma, he shows how essential oils can also ameliorate the debilitating side effects of chemotherapy and other cancer treatments as well as how even home use of essential oils for relaxation or skin care can help build one’s immunity and overall well-being.","Health,Nonfiction,Reference,Self Help,Science,Unfinished,Medicine,Alternative Medicine",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1364138111l/11631089.jpg,1594774250,https://goodreads.com/book/show/11631089-the-healing-intelligence-of-essential-oils,240,4.06,34,The Healing Intelligence of Essential Oils: The Science of Advanced Aromatherapy,386
Robert Barron," What I propose to do in this book is to take you on a guided exploration of the Catholic world, but not in the manner of a docent, for I am not interested in showing you the artifacts of Catholicism as though they were dusty ,objets d art, in a museum of culture. I want to function rather as a mystagogue, conducting you ever deeper into the mystery of the incarnation in the hopes that you might be transformed by its power. , ,Father Robert Barron,What is Catholicism? A 2,000-year-oldliving tradition? A worldview? A way of life? A relationship? A mystery? In ,Catholicism ,Father Robert Barron examines all these questions and more, seeking to capture the body, heart and mind of the Catholic faith. ,Starting from the essential foundation of Jesus Christ s incarnation, life, and teaching, Father Barron moves through the defining elements of Catholicism from sacraments, worship, and prayer, to Mary, the Apostles, and Saints, to grace, salvation, heaven, and hell using his distinct and dynamic grasp of art, literature, architecture, personal stories, Scripture, theology, philosophy, and history to present the Church to the world. ,Paired with his documentary film series of the same title, ,Catholicism ,is an intimate journey, capturing The Catholic Thing in all its depth and beauty. Eclectic, unique, and inspiring, Father Barron brings the faith to life for a new generation, in a style that is both faithful to timeless truths, while simultaneously speaking in the language of contemporary life. ,Includes over 100 black and white and color photos.""","Religion,Christianity,Catholic,Religion,Theology,Nonfiction,Religion,Faith,Religion,Christianity,Christian,Spirituality,History,Philosophy",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1320565130l/11631101.jpg,307720519,https://goodreads.com/book/show/11631101-catholicism,279,4.5,277,Catholicism: A Journey to the Heart of the Faith,2998
Simi Linton,"While hitchhiking from Boston to Washington, D.C., in 1971 to protest the war in Vietnam, Simi Linton was involved in a car accident that paralyzed her legs and took the lives of her young husband and her best friend. Her memoir begins with her struggle to regain physical and emotional strength and to resume her life in the world. Then Linton takes us on the road she traveled (with stops in Berkeley, Paris, Havana) and back to her home in Manhattan, as she learns what it means to be a disabled person in America. ,Linton eventually completed a Ph.D., remarried, and began teaching at Hunter College. Along the way she became deeply committed to the disability rights movement and to the people she joined forces with. The stories in ,My Body Politic, are populated with richly drawn portraits of Linton's disabled comrades, people of conviction and lusty exuberance who dance, play-and organize--with passion and commitment.,My Body Politic, begins in the midst of the turmoil over Vietnam and concludes with a meditation on the U.S. involvement in the current war in Iraq and the war's wounded veterans. While a memoir of the author's gradual political awakening, ,My Body Politic, is filled with adventure, celebration, and rock and roll-Salvador Dali, James Brown, and Jimi Hendrix all make cameo appearances. Linton weaves a tale that shows disability to be an ordinary part of the twists and turns of life and, simultaneously, a unique vantage point on the world.

By the time she was at Smith College, when this book begins, she had settled into a nearly daily routine with her journal, which was also a sourcebook for her writing. Plath once called her journal her “Sargasso,” her repository of imagination, “a litany of dreams, directives, and imperatives,” and in fact these pages contain the germs of most of her work. Plath’s ambitions as a writer were urgent and ultimately all-consuming, requiring of her a heat, a fantastic chaos, even a violence that burned straight through her. The intensity of this struggle is rendered in her journal with an unsparing clarity, revealing both the frequent desperation of her situation and the bravery with which she faced down her demons.

The papers are missing. The village is alive with gossip. Did her elderly neighbors, suspected of being witches, really see nighttime prowlers and ghosts in the cottage garden? Kate's search for the truth brings her together with many childhood friends and neighbors, some suspicious of her return, but most eager to help. It also leads her down a trail of family bitterness, jealousy, and revenge - and into an exploration of her own past.","Mystery,Fiction,Romance,Historical,Historical Fiction,Gothic,Romance,Romantic Suspense,European Literature,British Literature,Suspense,Historical,Thriller,Mystery Thriller",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1387700717l/116342.jpg,449000613,https://goodreads.com/book/show/116342.Rose_Cottage,264,3.61,369,Rose Cottage,4189

,In the wake of rejection, abuse, gossip or betrayal, ""Forgive and forget"" or ""Christians aren't perfect, just forgiven"" doesn't make the hurt go away.,No one expects the church to be perfect. But we do think that God's family should treat us with more kindness and compassion than the rest of the world does. Because our hopes for the church are great, the disappointment we feel when the church fails to live up to its promise is devastating.,Wounds caused by strangers are painful enough. Injuries inflicted by people we count as friends are crushing. Yet the wounds we receive at the hands of fellow Christians cause a wasting sickness of the soul. Left unchecked and unhealed, they affect how we view ourselves, how we relate to other Christians even how we relate to God.,Drawing from the volumes of letters he and co-author David Johnson received in response to their book ,The Subtle Power of Spiritual Abuse,, Jeff VanVonderen looks at:,why hurts in the church are so debilitating.,what a welcoming, healing church should look like.,how anyone who feels let down by God's people can move past the pain and establish biblical relationships in a healthy church.,

John H. Walton,"The ancient Near Eastern mode of thought is not at all intuitive to us moderns, but our understanding of ancient perspectives can only approach accuracy when we begin to penetrate ancient texts on their own terms rather than imposing our own world view. In this task, we are aided by the ever-growing corpus of literature that is being recovered and analyzed.,After an introduction that presents some of the history of comparative studies and how it has been applied to the study of ancient texts in general and cosmology in particular, Walton focuses in the first half of this book on the ancient Near Eastern texts that inform our understanding about ancient ways of thinking about cosmology. Of primary interest are the texts that can help us discern the parameters of ancient perspectives on cosmic ontology—that is, how the writers perceived origins. Texts from across the ancient Near East are presented, including primarily Egyptian, Sumerian, and Akkadian texts, but occasionally also Ugaritic and Hittite, as appropriate. Walton’s intention, first of all, is to understand the texts but also to demonstrate that a functional ontology pervaded the cognitive environment of the ancient Near East. This functional ontology involves more than just the idea that ordering the cosmos was the focus of the cosmological texts. He posits that, in the ancient world, bringing about order and functionality was the very essence of creative activity. He also pays close attention to the ancient ideology of temples to show the close connection between temples and the functioning cosmos.,The second half of the book is devoted to a fresh analysis of Genesis 1:1–2:4. Walton offers studies of significant Hebrew terms and seeks to show that the Israelite texts evidence a functional ontology and a cosmology that is constructed with temple ideology in mind, as in the rest of the ancient Near East. He contends that Genesis 1 never was an account of material origins but that, as in the rest of the ancient world, the focus of “creation texts” was to order the cosmos by initiating functions for the components of the cosmos. He further contends that the cosmology of Genesis 1 is founded on the premise that the cosmos should be understood in temple terms. All of this is intended to demonstrate that, when we read Genesis 1 as the ancient document it is, rather than trying to read it in light of our own world view, the text comes to life in ways that help recover the energy it had in its original context. At the same time, it provides a new perspective on Genesis 1 in relation to what have long been controversial issues. Far from being a borrowed text, Genesis 1 offers a unique theology, even while it speaks from the platform of its contemporaneous cognitive environment.","Religion,Theology,Religion,Christian,Christianity,Old Testament",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1327353831l/11634692.jpg,157506216X,https://goodreads.com/book/show/11634692-genesis-1-as-ancient-cosmology,214,4.43,9,Genesis 1 as Ancient Cosmology,58

Ray Hyman,"Ever since the Society for Psychical Research was founded over a hundred years ago, parapsychologists have been attempting to prove the existence of paranormal phenomena - things like clairvoyance, telepathy, precognition, and remote viewing. This research into what is now often called ""psi"" has become increasingly technical. ""Controlled"" laboratory experiments have replaced ""systematic surveys of spontaneous occurrences""; complicated statistical analyses have replaced anecdotal data. In short, psychical research has aspired to the standards of ""hard science."",With what results? Ray Hyman is supremely qualified to say. A research psychologist held in the highest esteem by both parapsychologists and skeptics, Ray Hyman here reviews the history and methods of psychical research. The Elusive Quarry is Hyman's fascinating, fair-minded critique of the field, a book designed not to debunk but to discern.,In Part 1, ""Parapsychology,"" Hyman gives us a historical overview: Over the past hundred years, what have been the strongest claims made for the paranormal? Hyman gives close scrutiny to what have been called ""ganzfeld experiments,"" a body of research considered by parapsychologists to be especially compelling. Part 2, ""Scientists and the Paranormal,"" focuses on the scientists themselves - from Michael Faraday and Sir William Crookes in the last century to Helmut Schmidt and his recent work with random-event generators. Scientists have been interacting with an admittedly unique group of people: psychics. Are their methods of testing and reporting appropriate for the phenomena under examination?,Hyman steps outside of the laboratory for his book's third part, ""Psychic Phenomena,"" and evaluates the claims of ""water witching,"" occult healing, and remote viewing. In doing so, he demonstrates that one's interpretation of scientific data is strongly affected by one's underlying belief - or lack of belief - in paranormal phenomena.,In Part 4, ""The Psychology of Belief,"" Hyman vividly explains ""cold reading"" - that ability psychics have to convince strangers that they know all about them. It's an ability anybody can develop, Hyman says. The psychology is common, not psychic.",Science,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1369822158l/1163538.jpg,879755040,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1163538.The_Elusive_Quarry,447,4.5,2,The Elusive Quarry,8

Timothy Snyder,"The forgotten protagonist of this true account aspired to be a cubist painter in his native Kyïv. In a Europe remade by the First World War, his talents led him to different roles—intelligence operative, powerful statesman, underground activist, lifelong conspirator. Henryk Józewski directed Polish intelligence in Ukraine, governed the borderland region of Volhynia in the interwar years, worked in the anti-Nazi and anti-Soviet underground during the Second World War, and conspired against Poland’s Stalinists until his arrest in 1953. His personal story, important in its own right, sheds new light on the foundations of Soviet power and on the ideals of those who resisted it. By following the arc of Józewski’s life, this book demonstrates that his tolerant policies toward Ukrainians in Volhynia were part of Poland’s plans to roll back the communist threat.The book mines archival materials, many available only since the fall of communism, to rescue Józewski, his Polish milieu, and his Ukrainian dream from oblivion.

"David J. Eicher,James M. McPherson,Lee Vande,James Alan McPherson","Gettysburg Battlefield is the definitive illustrated history of the largest and deadliest military campaign ever waged in the Western Hemisphere. It was fought 140 years ago this July, in the farmlands of Pennsylvania. Years in the making, it draws together the most complete collection of Gettysburg imagery ever published in a single volume along with a robust narrative. The author takes the reader on a day-by-day journey through the battle, illustrated throughout with more than 480 photographs, many of them rare, including shots of Robert E. Lee and George Meade. Two visual features of this book are particularly compelling: Period photographs of key battlefield sites - taken just as the guns stilled - are juxtaposed with images of those same sites today. Three-dimensional maps were created especially for this book and offer a distinctive perspective on military strategy. Essays by civil war experts and a foreword by historian James M. McPherson complete this handsome and authoritative history. An essential addition to the Civil War library, Gettysburg Battlefield is a compelling chronicle of a legendary conflict and the ultimate pictorial record.","Military History,Civil War,History,American History,American Civil War,Nonfiction",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1181534777l/1163818._SX318_.jpg,811828689,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1163818.Gettysburg_Battlefield,296,4.36,1,Gettysburg Battlefield: The Definitive Illustrated History,28

Rick Stein,"
  ,',
,
  ,I've wanted to make a series in Spain for a long time. I love Spanish food, I've been going there since I was a young boy - but until quite recently I don't think people really took the food seriously. Thanks to a handful of really dedicated Spanish chefs and a growing enthusiasm for its rugged flavours, that has all begun to change. ,
,
  ,To me the underlying point of journeying to Spain would be to discover the 'duende' in the cooking. By that I mean a sense of soul, of authenticity. The word is normally used in flamenco but I think it could be equally applied to the art of Spanish cooking because to my mind, in really good food, there is a communication between the cook and diner that amounts to art.',
, Rick Stein,In his beautifully designed and illustrated cookbook to accompany a major BBC2, 4-part series, Rick has selected over 140 recipes that capture the authentic taste of Spain today. ,Spain is a country that tantalises every sense with its colourful sights, evocative music, vibrant traditions and bold cookery. Spanish cooking has a rich history, with flavours reflecting a broad range of cultural influences. Rick samples his way through the specialties and hidden treats of each region, taking in the changing landscape from the mountainous northern regions through the Spanish plains to Mediterranean beaches.,With over 100 Spanish recipes and location photographs, this is an essential cookbook for food-lovers as well as a stunning culinary guide to a diverse country.","Food and Drink,Cooking,Food and Drink,Cookbooks,Food and Drink,Food,Nonfiction",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1344727523l/11638329.jpg,184990135X,https://goodreads.com/book/show/11638329-rick-stein-s-spain,320,4.21,9,Rick Stein's Spain: 140 new recipes inspired by my journey off the beaten track,209

"Donald B. Kraybill,Steven M. Nolt,David L. Weaver-Zercher","On Monday morning, October 2, 2006, a gunman entered a one-room Amish school in Nickel Mines, Pennsylvania. In front of twenty-five horrified pupils, thirty-two-year-old Charles Roberts ordered the boys and the teacher to leave. After tying the legs of the ten remaining girls, Roberts prepared to shoot them execution with an automatic rifle and four hundred rounds of ammunition that he brought for the task. The oldest hostage, a thirteen-year-old, begged Roberts to ""shoot me first and let the little ones go."" Refusing her offer, he opened fire on all of them, killing five and leaving the others critically wounded. He then shot himself as police stormed the building. His motivation? ""I'm angry at God for taking my little daughter,"" he told the children before the massacre. The story captured the attention of broadcast and print media in the United States and around the world. By Tuesday morning some fifty television crews had clogged the small village of Nickel Mines, staying for five days until the killer and the killed were buried. The blood was barely dry on the schoolhouse floor when Amish parents brought words of forgiveness to the family of the one who had slain their children.,The outside world was incredulous that such forgiveness could be offered so quickly for such a heinous crime. Of the hundreds of media queries that the authors received about the shooting, questions about forgiveness rose to the top. Forgiveness, in fact, eclipsed the tragic story, trumping the violence and arresting the world's attention.,Within a week of the murders, Amish forgiveness was a central theme in more than 2,400 news stories around the world. The Washington Post, The New York Times, USA Today, Newsweek, NBC Nightly News, CBS Morning News, Larry King Live, Fox News, Oprah, and dozens of other media outlets heralded the forgiving Amish. From the Khaleej Times (United Arab Emirates) to Australian television, international media were opining on Amish forgiveness. Three weeks after the shooting, ""Amish forgiveness"" had appeared in 2,900 news stories worldwide and on 534,000 web sites.,Fresh from the funerals where they had buried their own children, grieving Amish families accounted for half of the seventy-five people who attended the killer's burial. Roberts' widow was deeply moved by their presence as Amish families greeted her and her three children. The forgiveness went beyond talk and graveside presence: the Amish also supported a fund for the shooter's family.,AMISH GRACE explores the many questions this story raises about the religious beliefs and habits that led the Amish to forgive so quickly. It looks at the ties between forgiveness and membership in a cloistered communal society and ask if Amish practices parallel or diverge from other religious and secular notions of forgiveness. It will also address the matter of why forgiveness became news. ""All the religions teach it,"" mused an observer, ""but no one does it like the Amish."" Regardless of the cultural seedbed that nourished this story, the surprising act of Amish forgiveness begs for a deeper exploration. How could the Amish do this? What did this act mean to them? And how might their witness prove useful to the rest of us?","Nonfiction,Amish,Religion,Christian,Crime,True Crime,History,Spirituality,Religion,Faith,Religion,Christianity,Audiobook",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348713889l/1163885.jpg,787997617,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1163885.Amish_Grace,237,3.78,455,Amish Grace: How Forgiveness Transcended Tragedy,2130

Pamela O. Long,"This book provides the historical background for a central issue in the history of science: the influence of artisans, craftsmen, and other practitioners on the emergent empirical methodologies that characterized the ""new sciences"" of the late sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Long offers a coherent account and critical revision of the ""Zilsel thesis,"" an influential etiological narrative which argues that such craftsmen were instrumental in bringing about the ""Scientific Revolution."" ""Artisan/Practitioners"" reassesses the issue of artisanal influence from three different perspectives: the perceived relationships between art and nature; the Vitruvian architectural tradition with its appreciation of both theory and practice; and the development of ""trading zones""--arenas in which artisans and learned men communicated in substantive ways. These complex social and intellectual developments, the book argues, underlay the development of the empirical sciences.,This volume provides new discussion and synthesis of a theory that encompasses broad developments in European history and study of the natural world. It will be a valuable resource for college-level teaching, and for scholars and others interested in the history of science, late medieval and early modern European history, and the Scientific Revolution.","History,Science,History Of Science,Science,History,European History",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1328774565l/11640667.jpg,870716093,https://goodreads.com/book/show/11640667-artisan-practitioners-and-the-rise-of-the-new-sciences-1400-1600,208,3.69,1,"Artisan/Practitioners and the Rise of the New Sciences, 1400-1600",16

"Lynn Arthur Steen,J. Arthur Seebach","According to the authors of this highly useful compendium, focusing on examples is an extremely effective method of involving undergraduate mathematics students in actual research. It is only as a result of pursuing the details of each example that students experience a significant increment in topological understanding. With that in mind, Professors Steen and Seebach have assembled 143 examples in this book, providing innumerable concrete illustrations of definitions, theorems, and general methods of proof. Far from presenting all relevant examples, however, the book instead provides a fruitful context in which to ask new questions and seek new answers.,Ranging from the familiar to the obscure, the examples are preceded by a succinct exposition of general topology and basic terminology and theory. Each example is treated as a whole, with a highly geometric exposition that helps readers comprehend the material. Over 25 Venn diagrams and reference charts summarize the properties of the examples and allow students to scan quickly for examples with prescribed properties. In addition, discussions of general methods of constructing and changing examples acquaint readers with the art of constructing counterexamples. The authors have included an extensive collection of problems and exercises, all correlated with various examples, and a bibliography of 140 sources, tracing each uncommon example to its origin.,This revised and expanded second edition will be especially useful as a course supplement and reference work for students of general topology. Moreover, it gives the instructor the flexibility to design his own course while providing students with a wealth of historically and mathematically significant examples. 1978 edition.","Science,Mathematics,Reference,Textbooks,Science,Physics",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1403739709l/116419.jpg,048668735X,https://goodreads.com/book/show/116419.Counterexamples_in_Topology,272,4.34,9,Counterexamples in Topology,89

Joe Mackall,"Joe Mackall has lived surrounded by the Swartzentruber Amish community of Ashland County, Ohio, for over sixteen years. They are the most traditional and insular of all the Amish sects: the Swartzentrubers live without gas, electricity, or indoor plumbing; without lights on their buggies or cushioned chairs in their homes; and without rumspringa, the recently popularized ""running-around time"" that some Amish sects allow their sixteen-year-olds.,Over the years, Mackall has developed a steady relationship with the Shetler family (Samuel and Mary, their nine children, and their extended family). ,Plain Secrets, tells the Shetlers' story over these years, using their lives to paint a portrait of Swartzentruber Amish life and mores. During this time, Samuel's nephew Jonas finally rejects the strictures of the Amish way of life for good, after two failed attempts to leave, and his bright young daughter reaches the end of school for Amish children: the eighth grade. But ,Plain Secrets, is also the story of the unusual friendship between Samuel and Joe. Samuel is quietly bemused—and, one suspects, secretly delighted—at Joe's ignorance of crops and planting, carpentry and cattle. He knows Joe is planning to write a book about the family, and yet he allows him a glimpse of the tensions inside this intensely private community. ,These and other stories from the life of the family reveal the larger questions posed by the Amish way of life. If the continued existence of the Amish in the midst of modern society asks us to consider the appeal of traditional, highly restrictive, and gendered religious communities, it also asks how we romanticize or condemn these communities—and why. Mackall's attempt to parse these questions—to write as honestly as possible about what he has seen of Amish life—tests his relationship with Samuel and reveals the limits of a friendship between ""English"" and Amish.","Nonfiction,Amish,Religion,Autobiography,Memoir,Sociology,Biography,History,Adult,Christian Fiction,Amish Fiction,Contemporary",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1320430097l/1164238.jpg,807010642,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1164238.Plain_Secrets,256,3.82,145,Plain Secrets: An Outsider among the Amish,731

Based on courses given at the University of Wales Swansea, it begins with a discussion of continuity and, by way of many examples, leads to the celebrated ""Hairy Ball theorem"" and on to homotopy and homology: the cornerstones of contemporary algebraic topology.,While containing all the key results of basic topology, Essential Topology never allows itself to get mired in details. Instead, the focus throughout is on providing interesting examples that clarify the ideas and motivate the student, reflecting the fact that these are often the key examples behind current research.,With chapters on:,continuity and topological spaces deconstructionist topology the Euler number homotopy groups including the fundamental group simplicial and singular homology, and fibre bundles,Essential Topology contains enough material for two semester-long courses, and offers a one-stop-shop for undergraduate-level topology, leaving students motivated for postgraduate study in the field, and well-prepared for it.","Science,Mathematics,Mathematics,Geometry,Science",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1344741709l/116426.jpg,1852337826,https://goodreads.com/book/show/116426.Essential_Topology,224,3.77,2,Essential Topology,13

A half-century ago, aircraft were primitive vehicles of war compared to the modern attackers of the Gulf War era, with their precision weapons, advanced navigational, sensor systems, and communications.

Alfred Kubin,"Alfred Kubin is one of the most accomplished draughtsmen of visions of the 20th century. Born in 1877 at Leitmeritz in Bohemia, Kubin spent his youth and years of study at the School of Applied Arts in Salzburg. He later studied art and took drawing lessons in Munich. Inspired by his fascination with the philosophies of Schopenhauer and Nietzsche, and influenced artistically by Goya, Klinger, Ensor, Redon, Rops and Munch, Kubin first found his own idiosyncratic ""Kubinesque"" set of motifs, rooted in dream visions, at the turn of the last century. He called his imagery a vital ""escape into the unreal"": ghostly figures, hybrid creatures, variants of torture and self-torture, dream, vampirism, spiritualism, decadence, sex, death and birth. His extraordinary oeuvre comprises more than 20,000 drawings, a large part of it pen drawings and portfolio pieces as well as illustrations for more than 70 books, all of them testifying to his gloomy world view.

"Ilan Stavans,Lalo Alcaraz","Latino USA represents the culmination of Ilan Stavans's lifelong determination to meet the challenges of capturing the joys, nuances, and multiple dimensions of Latino culture within the context of the English language. In this cartoon history of Latinos, Stavans seeks to combine the solemnity of so-called ""serious literature"" and history with the inherently theatrical and humorous nature of the comics. The range of topics includes Columbus, Manifest Destiny, the Alamo, William Carlos Williams, Desi Arnaz, West Side Story, Castro, Guevera, the Bay of Pigs, the Cuban Missile Crisis, Neruda, García Márquez, the Mariel Boatlift, and Selena. Stavans represents Hispanic civilization as a fiesta of types, archetypes, and stereotypes. These ""cliché figurines"" include a toucan (displayed regularly in books by García Márquez, Allende, and others), the beloved Latino comedian Cantinflas (known as ""the Hispanic Charlie Chaplin""), a masked wrestler, and Captain America. These multiple, at times contradictory voices, each narrating various episodes of Latino history from a unique perspective, combine to create a carnivalesque rhythm, democratic and impartial. For, as Stavans states, ""History, of course, is a kaleidoscope where nothing is absolute."" Latino USA, like the history it so entertainingly relates, is a dazzling kaleidoscope of irreverence, wit, subversion, anarchy, politics, humanism, celebration, and serious and responsible history.","Sequential Art,Graphic Novels,History,Nonfiction,Sequential Art,Comics,Politics,Cultural,Graphic Novels Comics,Education",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1347692232l/1164369.jpg,465082211,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1164369.Latino_USA,192,3.83,42,Latino USA: A Cartoon History,230

"David W. Fischer,Alan E. Bessette","Unusual shapes and colors make many mushrooms alluring to the eye, while the exotic flavors and textures of edible mushrooms are a gourmet delicacy for the palate. Yet many people never venture beyond the supermarket offerings, fearing that all other mushrooms are poisonous. With amateur mushroom hunters especially in mind, David Fischer and Alan Bessette have prepared Edible Wild Mushrooms of North America. This field guide presents more than 100 species of the most delicious mushrooms, along with detailed information on how to find, gather, store, and prepare them for the table. More than 70 savory recipes, ranging from soups and salads to casseroles, canapes, quiches, and even a dessert, are included. Throughout, the authors constantly emphasize the need for correct identification of species for safe eating. Each species is described in detailed, nontechnical language, accompanied by a list of key identifying characteristics that reliably rule out all but the target species. Superb color photographs also aid in identification. Poisonous ""lookalikes"" are described and illustrated, and the authors also assess the risks of allergic or idiosyncratic reactions to edible species and the possibilities of chemical or bacterial contamination.","Food and Drink,Cookbooks,Food and Drink,Cooking,Nonfiction",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1347420155l/1164473.jpg,292720807,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1164473.Edible_Wild_Mushrooms_of_North_America,264,4.09,4,Edible Wild Mushrooms of North America: A Field-to-kitchen Guide,57

The young church at Thessalonica, having taken root during Paul's brief stay there, pondered when the end might come as well. Paul, in order to instruct them more fully, wrote them two letters, which taken together expound the ""already-and-not-yet"" character of his views of the end times. His instruction and counsel can serve us well today. In this careful study of 1-2 Thessalonians, G. K. Beale offers an introduction that sets the letters in context and surveys their general content, highlighting issues surrounding their occasion and purpose.

Howard W. Hunter,"In a general conference address in April 1993, President Howard W. Hunter asked members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, ""How often do we think of the Savior? How deeply and gratefully and how adoringly do we reflect on his life? How central to our lives do we know him to be?""    ,Living a more Christlike life has long been a theme of President Hunter's messages to the Saints. That We Might Have Joy presents thirty-two of these messages, each expressing his testimony that ""Christ's way is not only the right way, but ultimately the only way to hope and joy.""    ,The book is arranged in four parts,""Making Christ Our Exemplar,"" ""A Plea for Unity,"" ""Facing Trials and Tribulations,"" and ""Becoming Disciples of Christ."" Each chapter within these sections draws from the scriptures an important message illustrating how using the Savior's life and teachings as our guide can lead to greater peace of mind and joy.    ,President Hunter summarizes well this theme in his talk entitled ""Facing Trials and Tribulations"": ""Our task is to have the gospel in our lives and to be a bright light, a city set on a hill, that reflects the beauty of the gospel of Jesus Christ and the joy and happiness that will always come to every people in every age who keep the commandments.""","Christianity,Lds,Religion,Religion,Church,Nonfiction,Lds,Lds Non Fiction",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1208295828l/1164524.jpg,875798764,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1164524.That_We_Might_Have_Joy,197,4.39,14,That We Might Have Joy,116
LeRoy Eims,"""Every believer in Jesus Christ deserves the opportunity of personal nurture and development."" says LeRoy Eims. But all too often the opportunity isn't there. We neglect the young Christian in our whirl of programs, church services, and fellowship groups. And we neglect to raise up workers and leaders who can disciple young believers into mature and fruitful Christians. In simple, practical, and biblical terms, LeRoy Eims revives the lost art of disciple making. He explains: - How the early church discipled new Christians - How to meet the basic needs of a growing Christian - How to spot and train potential workers - How to develop mature, godly leaders ""True growth takes time and tears and love and patience,"" Eims states. There is no instant maturity. This book examines the growth process in the life of a Christian and considers what nurture and guidance it takes to develop spiritually qualified workers in the church.","Christianity,Discipleship,Christian,Christian,Christian Living,Nonfiction,Religion,Christianity,Religion,Leadership,Religion,Church,Religion,Faith,Spirituality",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1344742349l/1164536.jpg,031037281X,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1164536.The_Lost_Art_of_Disciple_Making,192,4.08,45,The Lost Art of Disciple Making,593

New believers find themselves on their own, trying to figure out what their new life is supposed to look like. In this well-loved book, Bill Hull explains why disciple-making must be the focus of every believer's life and shows how each of us can do it.

It... establishes that Joseph Smith's murder, rather than being the deadly outcome of a spontaneous mob uprising, was in fact a carefully planned military-style execution. It is now possible to identify many of the key individuals engaged in planning his assassination as well as those who took part in the assault on Carthage jail. And furthermore, this study presents incontrovertible evidence that the effort to remove the Mormon leader from power and influence extended well beyond Hancock County [Illinois] (and included prominent Whig politicians as well as the Democratic governor of the state), thereby transforming his death from an impulsive act by local vigilantes into a political assassination sanctioned by some of the most powerful men in Illinois.

Leon Fink,"The arrival of several hundred Guatemalan-born workers in a Morganton, North Carolina, poultry plant sets the stage for this dramatic story of human struggle in an age of globalization. When laborers' concerns about safety and fairness spark a strike and, ultimately, a unionizing campaign at Case Farms, the resulting decade-long standoff pits a recalcitrant New South employer against an unlikely coalition of antagonists. Mayan refugees from war-torn Guatemala, Mexican workers, and a diverse group of local allies join forces with the Laborers union. The ensuing clash becomes a testing ground for new labor workplace and legal strategies. In the process, the nation's fastest-growing immigrant region encounters a new struggle for social justice. ,Using scores of interviews, Leon Fink gives voice to a remarkably resilient people. He shows that, paradoxically, what sustains these global travelers are the ties of local community. Whether one is finding a job, going to church, joining a soccer team, or building a union, kin and linguistic connections to the place of one's birth prove crucial in negotiating today's global marketplace. ,A story set at the intersection of globalization and community, two words not often linked, ,The Maya of Morganton, addresses fundamental questions about the changing face of labor in the United States.","History,Labor,Academic,School,Nonfiction,Race",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348200159l/1164618.jpg,807854476,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1164618.The_Maya_of_Morganton,272,3.7,4,The Maya of Morganton: Work and Community in the Nuevo New South,69

Theodore Millon,"Praise for the first edition. . . ""This book should be read by everyone who wishes to reclaim the lost land of personality theory and personality disorders (it's so good that I was tempted to say read by anyone who has a personality).

Indeed, Dr. Millon has been universally recognized as a pioneer and leading authority in this rapidly evolving field. As one of the founders of the Journal of Personality Disorders, a prime organizer of the International Society for the Study of Personality Disorders, and a full member of the DSM-IVTM, Axis II Work Group, he has played a dominant role in shaping the character of this extraordinarily challenging area of psychological study.,In this new edition, practitioners, researchers, teachers, and students will find the same clarity of insight that made the previous edition the standard text on personality disorders. Like its predecessor, the Second Edition guides the reader through the special complexities of this group of disorders and aids clinicians in the difficult work of diagnosis. It serves as an indispensable companion volume to DSM-IVTM, especially in the light of advances that have transformed personality disorders from an area of marginal relevance in diagnostic practice to one that is now central to the comprehensive multiaxial format. Major revisions and an almost doubling in length make this book more valuable than ever before:,A revised theoretical framework--from a learning theory-biosocial framework to a more evolutionary model that includes constructs applicable to phylogenesis and human adaptive styles An expansion of the 15 basic personality prototypes into personality disorder subcategories, resulting in over 60 additional adult subtypes An enlarged review of historical and contemporary thinking on personality disorders that makes this an invaluable single sourcebook for evaluating various theories A substantial expansion of the ""Clinical Picture"" section of each chapter now incorporates eight realms of patient data, and therefore facilitates the selection of modalities of therapeutic intervention Comprehensive reviews of the newer personality prototypes, such as avoidant, narcissistic, borderline, schizotypal, depressive, sadistic, and masochistic,Detailed discussion of frequent Comor-bid Axis I and Axis II diagnoses--a feature especially useful to those in managed care practices An instructive discussion of childhood personality disorders, a subject frequently ignored in the literature Major new chapters on personality assessment and personality therapy, including an up-to-date review of available instruments Expanded and detailed discussion of short-term, focused therapy Comprehensive, authoritative, and superbly organized, Disorders of Personality: DSM-IVTM and Beyond is an absolutely essential resource for psychiatrists, clinical psychologists and social workers, teachers, students, researchers, and all others who seek greater understanding of the complex web of human personality disorders.","Psychology,Nonfiction,Medicine,Psychiatry",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1387734706l/1164675.jpg,047101186X,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1164675.Disorders_of_Personality,832,4.14,2,Disorders of Personality: DSM-IV™ and Beyond,56
Joe Lovejoy,"An enlightening account of the FA Premier League's eventful first 20 years,Born 20 years ago, in September 1991, the FA Premier League has since established itself as the most popular club competition in world football. But first it endured a struggle to survive in the face of opposition from the players' union and the Football League. It was touch and go for a year, then the breakaway elite faced a new crisis with the exposure of the game's ""bungs"" culture (payment made outside official arrangement), staining the reputations of Brian Clough and George Graham, among others. The new league was threatened again by the very real possibility of financial meltdown, averted only by a widespread and controversial takeover of many top clubs by predatory owners from overseas. Joe Lovejoy, chief football writer at the ,Independent, at the time, reported on the creation of the Premier League, and revisits the story here, interviewing many of the ""founding fathers"" to cast new light on its arrival. Later, as chief football correspondent at the ,Sunday Times,, Lovejoy had an up close and personal view of all the main events, and has spoken again to those involved to shed new light on the best matches, best players, and stand-out incidents of the Premier League's enthralling first 20 years.",Soccer,https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1320551376l/11646907.jpg,1845967682,https://goodreads.com/book/show/11646907-glory-goals-and-greed,240,3.72,1,"Glory, Goals and Greed: Twenty Seasons of the Premier League",18
Mari Ruti,"We are conditioned to think that love heals wounds, makes us happy, and gives our lives meaning. When the opposite occurs and love causes fracturing, disenchantment, and existential turmoil, we suffer deeply, especially if we feel that love has failed us or that we have failed to experience what others seem so effortlessly to enjoy.,In this eloquently argued, psychologically informed book, Mari Ruti portrays love as a much more complex, multifaceted phenomenon than we tend to appreciate--an experience that helps us encounter the depths of human existence. Love's ruptures are as important as its triumphs, and sometimes love succeeds because it fails. At the heart of Ruti's argument is a meditation on interpersonal ethics that acknowledges the inherent opacity of human interiority and the difficulty of taking responsibility for what we cannot fully understand.,Yet the fact that humans are often irrational in love does not absolve us of ethical accountability. In Ruti's view, we must work harder to map the unconscious patterns motivating our romantic behavior. As opposed to popular spiritual approaches urging us to live fully in the now, Ruti treats the past as a living component of the present. Only when we catch ourselves at those moments when the past speaks in the present can we keep ourselves from hurting the ones we love. Equally important, Ruti emphasizes transcending our individual histories of pain, an act that allows us to face the unconscious demons that dictate our relational choices. Written with substance and compassion, ,The Summons of Love, restores the enlivening and transformative possibilities of romance.","Psychology,Psychoanalysis",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1310470933l/11646926.jpg,231158165,https://goodreads.com/book/show/11646926-the-summons-of-love,180,4.42,2,The Summons of Love,24

One of the world's most famous heritage sites, it has long been a national monument of Greece and a potent symbol of western civilization. But the Acropolis is typically viewed in the context of 5th-century-BC Athenian society, while the multiple local and international meanings and identities that the site shapes today are overlooked.,This book looks at the meaning of the Acropolis in contemporary Greece. How are global ideas adopted and adapted by local cultures? How do Greeks deal with the national and international features of their ancient classical heritage? How do the global cultural constructions surrounding the Acropolis become part of local practices which project Greek cultural difference?,The author examines this historic site as a powerful agent for negotiations of power on an international level.

When troops went to the Middle East to fight the Gulf War in 1991 and the Iraq War in 2003, many -- perhaps thousands -- received an experimental anthrax vaccine instead of the FDA-approved vaccine.

Ann Fessler,"A powerful and groundbreaking revelation of the secret history of the 1.5 million women who surrendered children for adoption in the several decades before ,Roe v. Wade, , In this deeply moving work, Ann Fessler brings to light the lives of hundreds of thousands of young single American women forced to give up their newborn children in the years following World War II and before ,Roe v. Wade,. ,The Girls Who Went Away, tells a story not of wild and carefree sexual liberation, but rather of a devastating double standard that has had punishing long-term effects on these women and on the children they gave up for adoption. Based on Fessler's groundbreaking interviews, it brings to brilliant life these women's voices and the spirit of the time, allowing each to share her own experience in gripping and intimate detail. Today, when the future of the ,Roe, decision and women's reproductive rights stand squarely at the front of a divisive national debate, Fessler brings to the fore a long-overlooked history of single women in the fifties, sixties, and early seventies. , In 2002, Fessler, an adoptee herself, traveled the country interviewing women willing to speak publicly about why they relinquished their children. Researching archival records and the political and social climate of the time, she uncovered a story of three decades of women who, under enormous social and family pressure, were coerced or outright forced to give their babies up for adoption. Fessler deftly describes the impossible position in which these women found themselves: as a sexual revolution heated up in the postwar years, birth control was tightly restricted, and abortion proved prohibitively expensive or life endangering. At the same time, a postwar economic boom brought millions of American families into the middle class, exerting its own pressures to conform to a model of family perfection. Caught in the middle, single pregnant women were shunned by family and friends, evicted from schools, sent away to maternity homes to have their children alone, and often treated with cold contempt by doctors, nurses, and clergy. , The majority of the women Fessler interviewed have never spoken of their experiences, and most have been haunted by grief and shame their entire adult lives. A searing and important look into a long-overlooked social history, ,The Girls Who Went Away, is their story.","Nonfiction,History,Feminism,Parenting,Adoption,Sociology,Womens,Autobiography,Memoir,Historical,Politics,Biography",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1581886762l/116477._SX318_.jpg,1594200947,https://goodreads.com/book/show/116477.The_Girls_Who_Went_Away,354,4.2,1083,The Girls Who Went Away: The Hidden History of Women Who Surrendered Children for Adoption in the Decades Before Roe V.

"Bernie Clark,Sarah Powers","Bernie Clark's ,The Complete Guide to Yin Yoga, provides an in-depth look at the philosophy and practice of Yin Yoga with illustrated sections on how to practice Yin Yoga, including descriptions with photographs of 30 Yin Yoga asanas.,All forms of yoga can provide benefits physically, emotionally, and mentally, however Yin Yoga works the deeper levels of the body/heart/mind: the connective tissues of the ligaments, fascia, joints and bones and the energetic channels of the meridians, nerves and blood system. One big difference noticed by students of Yin Yoga is the long-held, passive nature of the posture, which gives time for a deeper journey to unfold, a journey into the meditative aspects of yoga, a bridge to living life mindfully.,Clark presents comprehensive information on how to do the practice, including a deep look inside over two dozen Yin Yoga postures showing the benefit of the pose, how to get into and out of the pose, contraindications and warnings for those who may have trouble with particular aspects of the posture, and other important information.

Douglas Farr,"Written by the chair of the LEED-Neighborhood Development (LEED-ND) initiative, ,Sustainable Urbanism: Urban Design with Nature, is both an urgent call to action and a comprehensive introduction to sustainable urbanism--the emerging and growing design reform movement that combines the creation and enhancement of walkable and diverse places with the need to build high-performance infrastructure and buildings., , Providing a historic perspective on the standards and regulations that got us to where we are today in terms of urban lifestyle and attempts at reform, Douglas Farr makes a powerful case for sustainable urbanism, showing where we went wrong, and where we need to go. He then explains how to implement sustainable urbanism through leadership and communication in cities, communities, and neighborhoods. Essays written by Farr and others delve into such issues as: Increasing sustainability through density. Integrating transportation and land use. Creating sustainable neighborhoods, including housing, car-free areas, locally-owned stores, walkable neighborhoods, and universal accessibility. The health and environmental benefits of linking humans to nature, including walk-to open spaces, neighborhood stormwater systems and waste treatment, and food production. High performance buildings and district energy systems. Enriching the argument are in-depth case studies in sustainable urbanism, from BedZED in London, England and Newington in Sydney, Australia, to New Railroad Square in Santa Rosa, California and Dongtan, Shanghai, China. An epilogue looks to the future of sustainable urbanism over the next 200 years., , At once solidly researched and passionately argued, ,Sustainable Urbanism, is the ideal guidebook for urban designers, planners, and architects who are eager to make a positive impact on our--and our descendants'--buildings, cities, and lives.","Cities,Urban Planning,Architecture,Cities,Urbanism,Nonfiction,Environment,Sustainability,Geography,Cities,Urban,Design,Environment,Science,Geography",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348698487l/1164831.jpg,047177751X,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1164831.Sustainable_Urbanism,304,3.94,12,Sustainable Urbanism: Urban Design with Nature,177

Whitney Balliett,"When Whitney Balliett's ,American Musicians, first appeared in the fall of 1986, the acclaim it received was universal. Leonard Feather, writing in ,The Los Angeles Times,, said no other writer now living can write with comparable grace and equal enthusiasm about everyone from Jack Teagarden and Art Tatum to Cecil Taylor and Ornette Coleman. And Bruce Cook in ,The New Leader, called the book the quintessential Whitney Balliett, the cream of the cream, a collection that leaves no doubt about his strength., Now greatly expanded with sixteen new essays, ,American Musicians II, remains a superb introduction to the giants of jazz, or as Balliett himself calls it, a highly personal encyclopedia, a series of close accounts of how a beautiful music grew, flourished, and (possibly) began the long trek back to its native silences. Breathtaking in its scope, the book features Balliett's singular portraits of jazz greats who have shaped this uniquely American tradition from its earliest days to the present, from inimitable innovators like Joe King Oliver and Jelly Roll Morton, to swing-era mainstays Fats Waller and Lester Young, to avant-garde pioneers such as Cecil Taylor and Ornette Coleman. We are treated to profiles of Pee Wee Russell, Red Allen, Earl Hines, and Mary Lou Williams, written when they were at the height of their powers; reconstructions of the lives of Art Tatum, Coleman Hawkins, Jack Teagarden, Zoot Sims, and Dave Tough; quick but indelible glimpses into the daily (or nocturnal) lives of Duke Ellington and Charles Mingus; and vivid portrayals of such modern masters as Red Norvo, Buddy Rich, Elvin Jones, Art Farmer, Michael Moore, and Tommy Flanagan. This new edition adds essays on such major musicians as Benny Goodman, Charlie Parker, Dizzy Gillespie, George Shearing, and Paul Desmond., In the forty years that he has written for ,The New Yorker,, Whitney Balliett has earned the reputation as America's foremost jazz critic. The late Philip Larkin described him as a writer who brings jazz journalism to the verge of poetry. Alistair Cook wrote that he is, without a rival in sight, the most literate and knowledgeable living writer on jazz. And Gene Lees called him one of the most graceful essayists in the English language on ,any, subject. Now, with the second edition of ,American Musicians, in hand, music lovers can experience Balliett's peerless observations on the jazz scene, as he takes you into the hearts and minds of jazz's great practitioners.","Music,Music,Jazz",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1223630647l/1164871.jpg,195095383,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1164871.American_Musicians_II,528,4.29,1,American Musicians II: Seventy-One Portraits in Jazz,7

Roderick A. Ferguson,"The sociology of race relations in America typically describes an intersection of poverty, race, and economic discrimination. But what is missing from the picture--sexual difference--can be as instructive as what is present. In this ambitious work, Roderick A. Ferguson reveals how the discourses of sexuality are used to articulate theories of racial difference in the field of sociology. He shows how canonical sociology--Gunnar Myrdal, Ernest Burgess, Robert Park, Daniel Patrick Moynihan, and William Julius Wilson--has measured African Americans' unsuitability for a liberal capitalist order in terms of their adherence to the norms of a heterosexual and patriarchal nuclear family model. In short, to the extent that African Americans' culture and behavior deviated from those norms, they would not achieve economic and racial equality. Aberrations in Black tells the story of canonical sociology's regulation of sexual difference as part of its general regulation of African American culture. Ferguson places this story within other stories--the narrative of capital's emergence and development, the histories of Marxism and revolutionary nationalism, and the novels that depict the gendered and sexual idiosyncrasies of African American culture--works by Richard Wright, Ralph Ellison, James Baldwin, Audre Lorde, and Toni Morrison. In turn, this book tries to present another story--one in which people who presumably manifest the dys-functions of capitalism are reconsidered as indictments of the norms of state, capital, and social science. Ferguson includes the first-ever discussion of a new archival discovery--a never-published chapter of Invisible Man that deals with a gay character in a way thatcomplicates and illuminates Ellison's project. Unique in the way it situates critiques of race, gender, and sexuality within analyses of cultural, economic, and epistemological formations, Ferguson's work introduces a new mode of discourse--which Ferguson calls queer of color analysis--that helps to lay bare the mutual distortions of racial, economic, and sexual portrayals within sociology. A hard-hitting look at the regulation of sexual difference and its role in circumscribing African American culture.","GLBT,Queer,Race,Philosophy,Theory,Nonfiction,LGBT,GLBT,Queer Studies,Sociology,Academic,Gender and Sexuality,Sexuality",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1347510484l/1164964.jpg,816641293,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1164964.Aberrations_in_Black,175,4.32,14,Aberrations in Black: Toward a Queer of Color Critique,308

Raised according to the ancient ways and seeking to use her gifts to keep the old magic strong, she has the power to part the mists of time and see events that might shape a nation. ,But Aislinn’s own past is shrouded in mystery, and her quest to discover that past will bring her pain, as well as true love, and will set in motion a chain of events that will alter both her own future and that of her beloved Ireland.,For there is a new spirit upon the land whose presence heralds a rendering--and a remaking--of this world. His way had been foretold long ago and threatens to change everything. And Aislinn is at the heart of that change. ,Will she give up everything that she loves to help her people find the true God, or will she turn to the dark forces that threaten to keep the old ways at any cost?,Daughter of Ireland ,continues Juilene Osborne-McKnight's exploration of Irish history, combining fine historical research with skillful storytelling. Her focus this time is none other than Cormac mac Art, ancient and venerated King of Ireland, and the path the Irish people follow to find the one true God. Osborne-McKnight has crafted an engaging young heroine who chronicles both Celtic mythology and early pagan/Christian theology through her travels, and re-creates a world whose conflicts over power, religion, and law are as immediate and far-reaching as those same conflicts in our own time.","Historical,Historical Fiction,Cultural,Ireland,Fiction,Fantasy,Historical,Historical Fiction,Historical Fantasy,European Literature,Irish Literature,Romance,Contemporary",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1344864908l/1165023.jpg,076530127X,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1165023.Daughter_of_Ireland,300,3.73,28,Daughter of Ireland,262

Joshua S. Goldstein," An award-winning expert on international affairs and military history reveals the astounding truth about war: Peacekeeping is working. , Read the newspapers, and you'll be convinced war is worse than it's ever been: more civilian deaths, more rapes, more armed conflicts all around the world. But as leading scholar and writer Joshua Goldstein shows in this vivid, dramatic book, the reality is just the opposite. We are in the midst of a general decline in armed conflict that is truly extraordinary in human history. , ,Winning the War on War, is filled with startling observations, including: ,- 2010 had one of the lowest death rates from war, relative to population, of any year, ever. ,- No national armies are currently fighting one another--all current wars are civil wars. ,- UN peacekeeping actually works very well, and 79 percent of Americans support the UN, according to a recent poll. , Goldstein has compiled evidence ranging from the histories of UN peacekeeping missions to the latest Swedish data on armed conflicts. He tells the stories of peacekeeping failures such as Bosnia and Rwanda, but also the less heralded success stories such as Mozambique and El Salvador. In this ""boots on the ground"" account, Goldstein shows why global peacekeeping efforts are working--how large-scale looting, sexual assault, and genocidal atrocities are being stopped--and how we can continue winning the war on war.","Nonfiction,Politics,Political Science,International Relations,War,Military Fiction,Sociology,War",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1311281738l/11650945.jpg,525952535,https://goodreads.com/book/show/11650945-winning-the-war-on-war,400,3.42,16,Winning the War on War: The Decline of Armed Conflict Worldwide,113

And then one day in 1968, Swede's beautiful American luck deserts him.,For Swede's adored daughter, Merry, has grown from a loving, quick-witted girl into a sullen, fanatical teenager—a teenager capable of an outlandishly savage act of political terrorism.

The argument rests on widely accepted factual claims and impeccable sources. It avoids rhetoric and gratuitous moralizing. There is no attempt to blacken Israel through association with colonialism, imperialism, or racism. Instead, Neumann’s argument emphasizes the fateful Zionist quest for Jewish sovereignty in Palestine. This quest—not the massacres or plans for transfer or other blots on Zionist history—made violence inevitable and compromise impossible. The prospect of Zionists gaining the power of life and death over all inhabitants of Palestine ,had, to be seen by the Palestinians as a mortal threat. They responded accordingly.,The tragic consequences of the quest for sovereignty did not follow all at once, but in two stages. The Zionists established a sovereign Jewish state in 1948. Had they been content with that, peace might have followed the 1967 war, when Israel could have backed the creation of a Palestinian state in the occupied territories. Instead, Zionists pushed to extend Jewish sovereignty, this time through the settler movement. The settlements were a renewed mortal threat to the Palestinians and once again necessitated a violent response. The only solution is for Israel to withdraw, unilaterally, to its 1948 borders.,Michael Neumann, was born in 1946, the son of German Jewish refugees. He graduated from Columbia University with degrees in European history and English literature, followed by a doctorate in philosophy from the University of Toronto. He teaches moral and political philosophy at a Canadian university. He has written ,What’s Left?,, a critique of 1960s radicalism, and numerous articles relating to the Israel/Palestine conflict. His academic work includes ,The Rule of Law: Politicizing Ethics, as well as articles on utilitarianism, rationality, and rights.","Politics,Cultural,Israel,History,Nonfiction",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1328694331l/116530.jpg,1904859461,https://goodreads.com/book/show/116530.The_Case_Against_Israel,200,3.99,3,The Case Against Israel,75

Philip Roth,"I Married a Communist, is the story of the rise and fall of Ira Ringold, a big American roughneck who begins life as a teenage ditch-digger in 1930s Newark, becomes a big-time 1940s radio star, and is destroyed, as both a performer and a man, in the McCarthy witchhunt of the 1950s.,In his heyday as a star—and as a zealous, bullying supporter of ""progressive"" political causes—Ira marries Hollywood's beloved silent-film star, Eve Frame. Their glamorous honeymoon in her Manhattan townhouse is shortlived, however, and it is the publication of Eve's scandalous bestselling exposé that identifies him as ""an American taking his orders from Moscow."",In this story of cruelty, betrayal, and revenge spilling over into the public arena from their origins in Ira's turbulent personal life, Philip Roth—who ,Commonweal, calls the ""master chronicler of the American twentieth century—has written a brilliant fictional portrayal of that treacherous postwar epoch when the anti-Communist fever not only infected national politics but traumatized the intimate, innermost lives of friends and families, husbands and wives, parents and children.","Fiction,Literature,American,Novels,Literature,Historical,Historical Fiction,Literary Fiction,The United States Of America,Politics,Contemporary,American,Americana",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1390275847l/11653.jpg,375707212,https://goodreads.com/book/show/11653.I_Married_a_Communist,323,3.83,566,I Married a Communist,7433

Susan Niditch,"Ancient Israelite Religion, offers a brief, accessible, and perceptive account of the religious beliefs and practices of the ancient Israelites, analyzing the complex and varied ways in which they present and preserve themselves in the Hebrew Bible. Drawing on the most recent literary scholarship and archaeological evidence, the author provides a compelling account of how the culture of the Israelites changed over three great historical periods--the distant pre-monarchic age, the monarchies of Israel and Judah, and the Babylonian exile and return. The heart of the book is a rich description of the Israelites' religious life as revealed in the Hebrew Bible. Exploring how they described their experience of God, Niditch draws out consistent themes in the Biblical stories. Most importantly, she allows us to see the world through the Israelites' eyes as she reconstructs both their habits and their larger worldview. , Ideal for introduction to the Bible and introduction to religion courses, this insightful, subtly nuanced portrait is also easily understandable to general readers. It brings to life this ancient people whose legacy continues to influence and captivate the world today.","History,Religion,Christianity,Old Testament,History,Archaeology,Nonfiction",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1347508847l/116548.jpg,195091280,https://goodreads.com/book/show/116548.Ancient_Israelite_Religion,160,3.3,3,Ancient Israelite Religion,33
Denyse Bridger,"Cindi Lancourte is the illegitimate daughter of a powerful businessman and a lovely woman who worked for him. Acknowledged when his wife died, she was quickly relegated to the role of servant by his new wife and step-daughters, but an invitation to a Masquerade gives this Cinderella a new shot at happiness with a handsome Prince Charming.,Story Excerpt:,	""You can't be serious?"",	""Amerasha needs stability,"" King Alenzo Coranthaos reminded his only son. ""Our future lies with you!"", Michel Alexandros Coranthaos, heir to the island nation of Coranthis, turned from the castle window to look intently at his father. He tried to keep his voice even and free of the irritation that was coursing through his veins like a living thing. ""Father, you are in the prime of your years, hardly on the verge of dying of old age. I fail to see why you think it so necessary for me to marry and produce offspring!"",	His father's shoulders stiffened at the words and Michel sighed inwardly. He schooled his expression to careful neutrality and waited for the rebuke he sensed was coming to him.,	""Why do you think it so necessary to remain unmarried, Michel?"",	Startled by the calm question, he took a few moments to seriously consider the question. He could be flippant about it, or he could for a change be honest. The expectancy in his father's eyes decided him and he crossed the distance between them.,	""I don't think it's unnecessary, father. I simply choose to wait for a woman I can love and respect, someone I can share my life with, as you did with mother."",	Alenzo looked at his son, and nodded, expression grave.,	""I wish to see you happy, Michel."" He held up a hand to ward off the reply Michel was about to make and smiled, albeit with sadness. ""You have played the carefree prince for many years, but there is an emptiness in your life that needs to be filled. Tell me this is not truth? If you can?"",	Michel stared, genuinely surprised by the turn of the conversation. He'd answered his father's summons with the expectation of another of their increasingly frequent arguments. Instead, he was being accorded a direct honesty that had once been the core of their relationship, but had often been lacking in years. He sat down and for a few moments he remained silent, then he leaned back in the comfortable chair and nodded.,	""There is no sense denying what you say, father. I am not a happy man,"" he admitted, then laughed with real bitterness. ""I don't lack for attention, but it feels very hollow."",	Alenzo nodded. ""It's time to bring a bride to you, my son."",	Michel frowned, and waited for the trap to spring.

William G. Dever,"This book addresses one of the most timely and urgent topics in archaeology and biblical studies -- the origins of early Israel. For centuries the Western tradition has traced its beginnings back to ancient Israel, but recently some historians and archaeologists have questioned the reality of Israel as it is described in biblical literature. In ,Who Were the Early Israelites and Where Did They Come From?, William Dever explores the continuing controversies regarding the true nature of ancient Israel and presents the archaeological evidence for assessing the accuracy of the well-known Bible stories., Confronting the range of current scholarly interpretations seriously and dispassionately, Dever rejects both the revisionists who characterize biblical literature as ""pious propaganda"" and the conservatives who are afraid to even question its factuality. Attempting to break through this impasse, Dever draws on thirty years of archaeological fieldwork in the Near East, amassing a wide range of hard evidence for his own compelling view of the development of Israelite history., In his search for the actual circumstances of Israel's emergence in Canaan, Dever reevaluates the Exodus-Conquest traditions in the books of Exodus, Numbers, Joshua, Judges, and 1 & 2 Samuel in the light of well-documented archaeological evidence from the late Bronze Age and early Iron Age. Among this important evidence are some 300 small agricultural villages recently discovered in the heartland of what would later become the biblical nation of Israel. According to Dever, the authentic ancestors of the ""Israelite peoples"" were most likely Canaanites -- together with some pastoral nomads and small groups of Semitic slaves escaping from Egypt -- who, through the long cultural and socioeconomic struggles recounted in the book of Judges, managed to forge a new agrarian, communitarian, and monotheistic society., Written in an engaging, accessible style and featuring fifty photographs that help bring the archaeological record to life, this book provides an authoritative statement on the origins of ancient Israel and promises to reinvigorate discussion about the historicity of the biblical tradition.,  ","History,Religion,History,Archaeology,Nonfiction,Religion,Judaism,Christianity,Old Testament,Science,History,Ancient History,Cultural,Israel,Cultural",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348120891l/116549.jpg,802844162,https://goodreads.com/book/show/116549.Who_Were_the_Early_Israelites_and_Where_Did_They_Come_From_,280,3.88,27,Who Were the Early Israelites and Where Did They Come From?,179

His is the skeptical, enveloping intelligence that calculates the price that's paid in the struggle to change personal fortune and reshape history, whether in a dentist's office in suburban New Jersey, or in a tradition-bound English Village in Gloucestershire, or in a church in London's West End, or in a tiny desert settlement in Israel's occupied West Bank.","Fiction,Novels,Literature,Literature,American,Literature,Jewish,Literary Fiction,Religion,Contemporary,Literature,20th Century,Religion,Judaism",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1327936114l/11655.jpg,,https://goodreads.com/book/show/11655.The_Counterlife,336,3.91,320,The Counterlife,4358
Marita van der Vyver,"Tien vriende wat oor ‘n tydperk van tien jaar byeenkom – en onder andere emigrasie, spermtellings, oudword en seksuele frustrasie bespreek – is die spil van hierdie roman. ,Wegkomkans, is 'n roman oor die verhouding tussen tien vriende oor 'n tydperk van tien jaar, wat strek van die politieke noodtoestand in die jare tagtig tot die demokratiese bevryding. Soos in 'n stadige dans beweeg hulle om mekaar, nader en verder, en weer nader, en deel in mekaar se ekstase en smart, vrese en fantasiee. Hulle ontmoet mekaar tydens ""wegkomkanse"" by die see, gewoonlik in 'n strandhuis, en praat oor politieke geweld en emigrasie, seksuele frustrasies, spermtellings en plooie. Soms met spot en selfspot, soms hartstogtelik. Die huwelik loop vir byna almal in die groep op 'n fiasko uit, nuwe verleidings en verhoudings volg, en die vreugde en risiko van ouerskap word 'n nuwe gesprekstema. Tegelyk begin die jeugdige glans verdof, en pynlike werklikhede keer die blik na binne. Uiteindelik is dit vriendskap wat die aanslag van tyd en trauma deurstaan; wat 'n skans teen verlies vorm. ,Wegkomkans, bied prikkelende insigte in mense se versugtinge en ontnugteringe; in die verraderlikheid van die hart.","Fiction,Southern Africa,South Africa",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1463658643l/1165600._SY475_.jpg,062403755X,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1165600.Wegkomkans,613,3.95,12,Wegkomkans,224

Charlotte Gray,"Award-winning author Charlotte Gray's latest biography, ,Reluctant Genius: The Passionate Life and Inventive Mind of Alexander Graham Bell, offers an eye-opening account of the famously white-bearded inventor of the telephone. Who knew that he also was a pivotal figure in the development of the airplane, the hydrofoil, genetic engineering, and more? Charlotte Gray does, and she tells us how and why she brought to life the passionate mind and heart of the man behind so many amazing ideas and innovations. ,--Lauren Nemroff, , 
  ,Some Questions for Charlotte Gray,
,[image] ,1. Most people picture Alexander Graham Bell as that grandfatherly looking man with a long white beard who invented the telephone. What's wrong with that image?, The image of Alexander Graham Bell as a kindly Santa Claus figure is the one we all know: It is as familiar as the one of Einstein with his hair in a frizzy grey mass. But when Alexander Graham Bell was struggling to invent the telephone, he was a skinny, clean-shaven, neurotically intense young man and a hypochondriac, with obsessive work habits and a very volatile nature. Reading his letters and journals, I was shocked to discover how often he would ricochet between euphoria and depression. Invention was Alexander Graham Bell's passion, but I frequently wondered whether, if he had not had an early success and the right wife, his difficult personality would have prevented him achieving anything., I think it is important to revise the grandfatherly stereotype of Bell in order to show that invention is difficult, and inventors are not easy, placid people to live with., ,2. In what way does Bell's genius different from other inventors of his age, such as Thomas Edison or the Wright brothers?, The wonderful thing about the inventions of such nineteenth century giants as Bell, Edison and the Wright brothers is that, with a little bit of effort, even those of us who never did Grade 12 physics can actually understand how their inventions worked. One could never say that about today's microelectronic technology., Intuition and imagination were all crucial for the breakthroughs made by Edison, the Wright brothers and Bell. However, what sets Bell apart from Edison and the Wright brothers was that he didn't have an entrepreneurial bone in his body. He was more like a holdover from the eighteenth century Enlightenment, while the others were go-getting twentieth-century hustlers. Edison was always looking for financial backers; he announced his breakthroughs before he had even built working prototypes; he was one of the first inventors to put together a real R and D team at a purpose-built laboratory, at Menlo Park. He understood that invention is, in his own words, ""One percent inspiration, ninety percent perspiration."" Similarly the Wright Brothers were eager to make money out of their flying machines. They refused to share their technological breakthroughs, guarded their patents fiercely, and wouldn't give any demonstrations to the public of their biplanes. Bell was the opposite--totally absorbed in extending the frontiers of knowledge, and completely careless about commercial exploitation of his ideas., ,3. Is it true that ""necessity is the mother of invention"" or is it something else?, Invention has many mothers - the right materials, a widespread understanding that this will improve the world in some way, the right individual to pursue the elusive dream. In the case of the telephone, one can argue that there was no overwhelming necessity for a new form of communication: the telegraph had been working well for 30 years, and only a few people realized that a device that could carry the human voice, rather than the Morse code, would pull people together in a revolutionary way. As soon as telephones appeared in the market, their advantages were obvious. But there was still incredible resistance. In Britain, the upper classes were slow to acquire telephones because they posed a class issue: who should answer them? Everybody knew that, in a house with servants, the servant answered the door when the telegraph boy rang the bell. But should master or servant speak on the phone? , The democratic nature of the telephone--,anybody, could use it, not just qualified operators--also shackled its spread. In Russia after the revolution, Stalin is said to have vetoed the idea of a modern telephone system. ""It will unmake our work,"" the dictator decreed. ""No greater instrument for counter-revolution and conspiracy can be imagined."" So did necessity drive the invention of the telephone? No--when Bell first started speculating on its impact, people thought he was mad. But it quickly became a total necessityimagine life without electronic communication today!, ,4. It was amazing to learn that Bell's mother and his wife were both deaf, and that from an early age he was immersed in research on the nature of sound and oral communication. How important were these personal relationships in shaping his outlook and inventions?, , One of my greatest surprises when I started research for ,Reluctant Genius, was the discovery that Bell's first ambition was to be a teacher of the deaf, and that he remained committed to the cause of improved education for the hearing impaired throughout his life. I had no idea of this side of him, or of his long relationship with Helen Keller., The fact that the two most important women in his life, his mother and his wife, were deaf was of crucial importance both to his own work, and to his attitude to others. His respect for their intelligences and personalities meant that, unlike many of his contemporaries, he never assumed that deafness was linked to intellectual disability. Moreover, his scientific interest in their condition informed his telephone research. Because he knew why their ears didn't work, he understood how sound should reach the brain in a hearing person's ear, through the ear drum. None of his competitors made that intuitive leap. Their early attempts to build working telephones were foiled because they didn't include the diaphragm that mimicked the action of the ear drum, and which was the key feature of Bell's first phone., Lastly, Bell was also fascinated by the intergenerational transmission of deafness. This led to his research on genetics in general - and the program he initiated at his summer home, in Cape Breton, to breed a flock of ""super sheep"" that would always have twin births., ,5. Bell's wife, Mabel Hubbard Bell, was a remarkable person in her own right. Why was it so important to tell her story?, Too often, biographies of ""Great Men"" suggest they achieved everything by their own efforts. A few did, of course, but most depended on the support and encouragement of others--parents, partners, associates--to provide the right environment in which they could achieve their goals. Behind every great man.This was the case with Alexander Graham Bell. He would always have had his ""Eureka Moment"", in the summer of 1874, when he realized how a ""talking telegraph"" might work. But without Mabel, we probably would never have heard of him. He would not have patented the invention or found the business partners who helped him moved his invention from the laboratory to the market place. Mabel's father, Gardiner Hubbard, was his patent lawyer: Mabel herself ensured that he went to the Philadelphia Exposition, in 1876, to demonstrate his new apparatus., In later years, Mabel provided all kinds of other practical help, in ensuring that her exasperating husband could focus on his inventions. She handled the financial side of their marriage: she found qualified young men who could help him work on his flying machines: she was always cheering him up and stroking his ego when he got depressed. And she created, along with their two daughters, a warm family environment which gave balance to Bell's life - and which so many of his contemporaries, including Thomas Edison, never enjoyed., I was determined to give Mabel her due in the story of Bell. I found her such an attractive and intriguing figure. She was stone deaf, ten years younger than her husband, and their relationship began as a teacher-student one. It would be easy to assume that this brilliant, world famous man would be the dominant figure in the relationship. In fact, the reverse is true., ,6. What do you think Bell would think of cell phones, the internet and other wireless means of communication?, Bell himself anticipated ""electric communication"": he was very frustrated by how long it took for a letter from Nova Scotia to reach Europe. I'm sure he would be delighted by the internet., However, he would be appalled by the constant buzz of other technological advances, and the way we've allowed them to trump all other forms of human intercourse. This is a man who wouldn't have a telephone in his own study, because its ring would disturb his train of thought. He was a gracious, well-mannered man who would have been horrified by the way many of us let our cell phones to interrupt our face-to-face conversations. And if somebody pulled out a Blackberry and started punching into it while Bell was speaking of him--well, Alec would have muttered, ""Shee-e-esh"" (the nearest he ever got to swearing) and stomped out of the room., ,7. What was the most exciting research discovery that you made?, As a biographer, I have to say that my most exciting discovery was the wealth of material I had to work with. Because Alexander Graham Bell could never speak to his wife on the telephone, he and Mabel exchanged long, intimate, colourful letters whenever they were apart--and that was often. I was thrilled to discover, at the Alexander Graham Bell Historic Site in Baddeck, Nova Scotia, 180 three-ring binders of family correspondence (another set is housed at the Library of Congress, Washington.) These letters let me explore the inner-workings of the mind of a genius, and of a remarkable marriage, in a way that I had hardly dared hope for., I was also amazed at the range of Bell's activities. The telephone, the photophone (which sent sounds down beams of light), an early iron lung, a desalination process for salt water, flying machines, hydrofoils, genetic experimentshis scientific interests were enormously varied. And at the same time, he was doing so much else, for example with the Smithsonian Institute, and the National Geographic Society. And throughout his career, there was his long-running commitment to deaf education. It was hard not to be overwhelmed!, ,8. What are you working on right now?, Yes, I'm already launched on my next biography. (In fact, I find it very hard ,not, to start my next book before the previous one is even in the stores--I have a psychological need to live both my own life and someone else's!) My next project is a short biography of Nellie McClung, the Canadian author and political activist. , , ,

"John Saker,Aaron McLean","Pinot Noir is a phenomenona global cult has developed around it over the last couple of decadesperhaps because its personality is hard to pin down. Often described as an iron fist in a velvet glove, its contradictions evoke a great deal of discussion, debate and passion. Cult membership rose steeply in the wake of the hit movie sideways, released in 2004. The Obsession of the films hopelessly Pinotstruck leading male, Miles, rubbed off on cinemas audiences everywhere, inducing an upward swing in demand that came to be known as the Sideways effect. AC Nielsen reported that in the US alone, sales of Pinot Noir rose 45% during the year following the films release. New Zealand is now a dominant player in the Pinot Noir world and the pace of this growth has been little short of staggering. In the space of a couple of decades the country became a south pacific stronghold for the grape and its attendant culture. Importantly, it showed that the local industry wasnt a onetrick pony, based around Marlboroughs vast holding pens of Sauvignon Blanc.

"Gary M. Burge,Lynn H. Cohick,Gene L. Green","The New Testament in Antiquity is a textbook for college and seminary students penned by three evangelical scholars with over fifty years of combined experience in the classroom. Their challenge was to build a text that would be engaging, academically robust, richly illustrated, and relevant to the modern student. This book strikes a balance between being accessible to all students and challenging them to explore the depths of the New Testament within its cultural worlds.The New Testament in Antiquity carefully develops how Jewish and Hellenistic cultures formed the essential environment in which the New Testament authors wrote their books and letters. It argues that knowing the land, history, and culture of this world brings remarkable new insights into how we read the New Testament itself. Numerous sidebars provide windows into the Jewish, Hellenistic, and Roman worlds and integrate this material directly with the interpretation of the literature of the New Testament. This is an ideal introductory text for classroom use, with ample discussion questions and bibliographies.","Christian,Christianity,New Testament,History,Nonfiction,Reference,Historical,Religion,Christianity,Education,Religion",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348272610l/1165797.jpg,310244951,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1165797.The_New_Testament_in_Antiquity,479,4.07,18,The New Testament in Antiquity: A Survey of the New Testament within Its Cultural Context,255
John Updike,"The ever-surprising John Updike’s twenty-second novel is a brilliant contemporary fiction that will surely be counted as one of his most powerful. It tells of eighteen-year-old Ahmad Ashmawy Mulloy and his devotion to Allah and the words of the Holy Qur’an, as expounded to him by a local mosque’s imam.,The son of an Irish-American mother and an Egyptian father who disappeared when he was three, Ahmad turned to Islam at the age of eleven. He feels his faith threatened by the materialistic, hedonistic society he sees around him in the slumping factory town of New Prospect, in northern New Jersey. Neither the world-weary, depressed guidance counselor at Central High School, Jack Levy, nor Ahmad’s mischievously seductive black classmate, Joryleen Grant, succeeds in diverting the boy from what his religion calls the Straight Path. When he finds employment in a furniture store owned by a family of recently immigrated Lebanese, the threads of a plot gather around him, with reverberations that rouse the Department of Homeland Security. ,But to quote the Qur’an: ,Of those who plot, God is the best.","Fiction,War,Terrorism,Literature,Contemporary,Literature,American,Novels,Thriller,Literary Fiction,Religion,Islam,Politics",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1386924479l/11657.jpg,307264653,https://goodreads.com/book/show/11657.Terrorist,320,3.17,535,Terrorist,4336
"Elio Vittorini,Alane Salierno Mason,Ernest Hemingway","Vittorini's Conversations in Sicily stands as a modern classic, not only for its powerful thematic resonance as one of the great novels of Italian anti-fascism but also as a trailblazer for its style, which blends literary modernism with the pre-modern fable in a prose of lyric beauty. Comparing Vittorini's work to Picasso's, Italo Calvino described Conversations as ""the book-Guernica."",The novel begins at a time in the narrator's life when nothing seems to matter; whether he is reading newspaper posters blaring of wartime massacres, lying in bed with his wife or girlfriend, or flipping through the pages of a dictionary it is all the same to him—until he embarks on a journey back to Sicily, the home he has not seen in some fifteen years. In traveling through the Sicilian countryside and in variously hilarious and tragic conversations with its people—his indomitable mother in particular—he reconnects with his roots and rediscovers some basic human values.,In the introduction Hemingway wrote for the American debut of ,Conversations, (published as ,In Sicily, by New Directions in 1949) he remarked: ""I care very much about Vittorini's ability to bring rain with him when he comes, if the earth is dry and that is what you need."" More recently, American critic Donald Heiney wrote that in this one book, Vittorini ""like Rabelais and Cervantes...adds a new artistic dimension to the history of literature.""","European Literature,Italian Literature,Cultural,Italy,Fiction,Literature,Novels,Literature,20th Century,Travel,Literary Fiction,Classics,Academic,Read For School",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348212366l/1165806.jpg,811214559,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1165806.Conversations_in_Sicily,202,3.74,132,Conversations in Sicily,1970

With this continuation of Agee and Evans's project, Maharidge and Williamson not only uncover some surprising historical secrets relating to the families and to Agee himself, but also effectively lay to rest Agee's fear that his work, from lack of reverence or resilience, would be but another offense to the humanity of its subjects. Williamson's ninety-part photo essay includes updates alongside Evans's classic originals.

Ian Howard,"From the battle of Maldon in 991 during the reign of �ethelred (the Unready), England was invaded by Scandinavian armies of increasing size and ferocity. Swein Forkbeard, king of Denmark, played a significant part in these invasions, which culminated in the domination of England and the long reign of his son, Cnut. This analysis of the invasions demonstrates beyond doubt that �thelred was no indolent and worthless king who bribed invading Vikings to goaway: his relationship with the Scandinavian armies was more complex and more interesting than has been supposed. It is equally apparent that Swein was more than a marauding Viking adventurer: he was a sophisticated politician who laid the foundations for a great northern empire which was ruled by his descendents for many years after his death. New insight into this exciting period of English history is gained by focusing on the activities of Swein Forkbeard and, after his death in 1014, the Danish warlord Thorkell the Tall, both outstanding warriors and political leaders of what is sometimes called 'the Second Viking Age'. Many factors leading to the invasions and conquest are investigated through a critical analysis of the chronology of events, an explanation of the economic background, plotting the itineraries of the Scandinavian armies, and a fresh examination ofthe sources, including the ,Anglo-Saxon Chronicle,, the ,Encomium,, and ,John of Worcester's Chronicle,.,IAN HOWARD has a PhD from Manchester University and is a Fellow of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales.

Kimberly S. Hanger,"During Louisiana’s Spanish colonial period, economic, political, and military conditions combined with local cultural and legal traditions to favor the growth and development of a substantial group of free blacks. In ,Bounded Lives, Bounded Places,, Kimberly S. Hanger explores the origin of antebellum New Orleans’ large, influential, and propertied free black—or ,libre,—population, one that was unique in the South. Hanger examines the issues ,libres, confronted as they individually and collectively contested their ambiguous status in a complexly stratified society.,Drawing on rare archives in Louisiana and Spain, Hanger reconstructs the world of late-eighteenth-century New Orleans from the perspective of its free black residents, and documents the common experiences and enterprises that helped solidify ,libres,’ sense of group identity. Over the course of three and a half decades of Spanish rule, free people of African descent in New Orleans made their greatest advances in terms of legal rights and privileges, demographic expansion, vocational responsibilities, and social standing. Although not all blacks in Spanish New Orleans yearned for expanded opportunity, Hanger shows that those who did were more likely to succeed under Spain’s dominion than under the governance of France, Great Britain, or the United States. ,The advent of U.S. rule brought restrictions to both manumission and free black activities in New Orleans. Nonetheless, the colonial ,libre, population became the foundation for the city’s prosperous and much acclaimed Creoles of Color during the antebellum era.

Sobel explores the origins and oddities of the planets through the lens of popular culture, from astrology, mythology, and science fiction to art, music, poetry, biography, and history.

Abraham Joshua Heschel,"According to the popular definition, a prophet is one who accurately predicts the future. But in the Jewish tradition, as Abraham Joshua Heschel explains in ,The Prophets,, these figures earn their title by witnessing the world around them with outstanding passion. Prophets are those whose ""life & soul are at stake"" in what they say about ""the mystery of [god's] relation to man."" They are ""some of the most disturbing people who have ever lived,"" & yet they are also ""the men whose image is our refuge in distress, & whose voice & vision sustain our faith."" Heschel's book, one of the classic texts on the subject, contains sophisticated, straightforward discussions of each of the Hebrew prophets, the primary themes of their preaching, & comparisons of Israel's prophets to those of other religions'. Heschel avoids the two great temptations in any discussion of prophesy: overstating the supernatural quality of a prophet's epiphany (""A prophet is a person, not a microphone"") & reducing prophesy to a merely human phenomenon. Instead, he describes the prophet's peculiar status as god's spokesman in a way that does justice to its complexity: ""He speaks from the perspective of god as perceived from the perspective of his own situation.--Michael Joseph Gross (edited)","Christianity,Old Testament,Religion,Religion,Judaism,Literature,Jewish,Religion,Theology",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1305151393l/1166039.jpg,61314218,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1166039.The_Prophets_Vol_1,251,4.45,2,"The Prophets, Vol 1",40

"Harve Zemach,Margot Zemach","Duffy and the Devil, was a popular play in Cornwall in the nineteenth century, performed at the Christmas season by groups of young people who went from house to house. The Zemachs have interpreted the folk tale which the play dramatized, recognizable as a version of the widespread Rumpelstiltskin story. Its main themes are familiar, but the character and details of this picture book are entirely Cornish, as robust and distinctive as the higgledy-piggledy, cliff-hanging villages that dot England's southwestern coast from Penzance to Land's End.,The language spoken by the Christmas players was a rich mixture of local English dialect and Old Cornish (similar to Welsh and Gaelic), and something of this flavor is preserved in Harve Zemach's retelling. Margot Zemach's pen-and-wash illustrations combine a refined sense of comedy with telling observation of character, felicitous drawing with decorative richness, to a degree that surpasses her own past accomplishments.,Duffy and the Devil, is a 1973 New York Times Book Review Notable Children's Book of the Year and Outstanding Book of the Year, a 1974 National Book Award Finalist for Children's Books, and the winner of the 1974 Caldecott Medal.","Childrens,Picture Books,Childrens,Folklore,Fantasy,Fairy Tales,Folk Tales,Fantasy,Fiction,Fantasy,Magic,Childrens,Juvenile,Realistic Fiction",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1379150799l/1166049.jpg,374418977,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1166049.Duffy_and_the_Devil,40,3.42,173,Duffy and the Devil,1036

"Luc Boltanski,Ève Chiapello","In this major work, the sociologists Eve Chiapello and Luc Boltanski go to the heart of the changes in contemporary business culture.,Via an unprecedented analysis of the latest management texts that have formed the thinking of employers in their organization of business, the authors trace the contours of a new spirit of capitalism. They argue that from the middle of the 1970s onwards, capitalism abandoned the hierarchical Fordist work structure and developed a new network-based form of organization which was founded on employee initiative and autonomy in the workplace – a ‘freedom’ that came at the cost of material and psychological security.,The authors connect this new spirit with the children of the libertarian and romantic currents of the late 1960s (as epitomised by dressed-down. cool capitalists such as Bill Gates and ‘Ben and Jerry’) arguing that they practice a more successful and subtle form of exploitation.,In a work that is already a classic in Europe, Boltanski and Chiapello show how the new spirit triumphed thanks to a remarkable recuperation of the Left’s critique of the alienation of everyday life – a recuperation that simultaneously undermined the power of its social critique.","Sociology,Economics,Politics,Philosophy,Nonfiction,Philosophy,Theory,Social Science,Academic,Politics,Political Science,Business",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1181573625l/1166150.jpg,1859845541,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1166150.The_New_Spirit_of_Capitalism,601,4.26,18,The New Spirit of Capitalism,218

So begins the fascinating and varied recollections of one of Gaskell's best-loved characters. Lured to rural Duncombe by the promise of a partnership in a country practice, William finds himself trapped in claustrophobic provincial life where society is apparently presided over by the scheming of a set of under-occupied middle-aged women. Their supposed matchmaking prowess in fact leaves much to be desired; so much so, indeed, that before long the hapless young physician finds himself betrothed to three women—none of whom is the beautiful Sophy, the woman he truly desires.

Vasily Peskov,"In the late 1970s, a Russian pilot flying over a remote, mountainous stretch of the Siberian taiga, the vast subarctic forest, spotted a tilled field hundreds of miles from any known settlement. He could not believe his eyes; in this forbidding part of the world, human habitation was a statistical impossibility. A team of scientists parachuted in and were stunned by what they found: a primitive wood cabin, and a family dressed in rags that spoke, thought, and lived in the manner of seventeenth-century Russian peasants during the reign of Tsar Peter the Great. How they come here, how they survived, and how they ultimately prevailed in a climate of unimaginable adversity make for one of the most extraordinary human adventures of this century. Acclaimed Pravda journalist Vasily Peskov has visited this family once a year for the past twelve years, gaining their trust and learning their story. It begins in the late seventeenth century, when a community of Russian Orthodox fundamentalists made a two-thousand-mile odyssey from the Ukraine to the depths of the Siberian taiga to escape religious persecution at the hands of Peter the Great, who sought to reform the Russian Orthodox Church. For nearly 250 years, this band of ""Old Believers"" kept the outside world at bay, but in the 1930s Stalin's brutal collectivization program swept East and threw them from their land. But the young family of Karp Osipovich Lykov refused to abandon the only way of life they knew, and fled even deeper into the desolate Siberian hinterland. By the time Peskov came to know them, they had been alone for more than fifty years, surviving solely on what they could harvest, hunt, and build by their own means. The sole surviving family member, the daughter Agafia, lives by herself in the Lykov family cabin to this day. In Lost in the Taiga, Peskov brings to life the Lykovs' faith, their doubt, and their epic struggle against an unyielding wilderness, even as he pays homage to a natural habitat th","Nonfiction,History,Cultural,Russia,Biography,Travel,Adventure,Religion,Adventure,Survival,Religion,Christianity,Biography Memoir",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1327951094l/1166194.jpg,385472099,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1166194.Lost_in_the_Taiga,254,4.01,77,Lost in the Taiga: One Russian Family's Fifty-Year Struggle for Survival and Religious Freedom in the Siberian Wilderness,480

"Hans Belting,Deborah Lucas Schneider","The use of perspective in Renaissance painting caused a revolution in the history of seeing, allowing artists to depict the world from a spectator's point of view. But the theory of perspective that changed the course of Western art originated elsewhere-it was formulated in Baghdad by the eleventh-century mathematician Ibn al Haithan, known in the West as Alhazen. Using the metaphor of the mutual gaze, or exchanged glances, Hans Belting-preeminent historian and theorist of medieval, Renaissance, and contemporary art-narrates the historical encounter between science and art, between Arab Baghdad and Renaissance Florence, that has had a lasting effect on the culture of the West.,In this lavishly illustrated study, Belting deals with the double history of perspective, as a visual theory based on geometrical abstraction (in the Middle East) and as pictorial theory (in Europe). How could geometrical abstraction be reconceived as a theory for making pictures? During the Middle Ages, Arab mathematics, free from religious discourse, gave rise to a theory of perspective that, later in the West, was transformed into art when European painters adopted the human gaze as their focal point. In the Islamic world, where theology and the visual arts remained closely intertwined, the science of perspective did not become the cornerstone of Islamic art. ,Florence and Baghdad, addresses a provocative question that reaches beyond the realm of aesthetics and mathematics: What happens when Muslims and Christians look upon each other and find their way of viewing the world transformed as a result?","History,Art,Art,Art History,Cultural,Italy,Nonfiction,Culture,Cultural Studies,Philosophy,Theory",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1327992255l/11663018.jpg,674050045,https://goodreads.com/book/show/11663018-florence-baghdad,312,4.01,9,Florence & Baghdad: Renaissance Art and Arab Science,77

Stuart A. Vyse,"Although we live in a technologically advanced society, superstition is as widespread as it has ever been. Far from limited to athletes and actors, superstitious beliefs are common among people of all occupations and every educational and income level. Here, Stuart Vyse investigates our proclivity towards these irrational beliefs. Superstitions, he writes, are the natural result of several well-understood psychological processes, including our human sensitivity to coincidence, a penchant for developing rituals to fill time (to battle nerves, impatience, or both), our efforts to cope with uncertainty, the need for control, and more. Vyse examines current behavioral research to demonstrate how complex and paradoxical human behavior can be understood through scientific investigation, while he addresses the personality features associated with superstition and the roles of superstitious beliefs in actions. Although superstition is a normal part of human culture, Vyse argues that we must provide alternative methods of coping with life's uncertainties by teaching decision analysis, promoting science education, and challenging ourselves to critically evaluate the sources of our beliefs.","Psychology,Philosophy,Skepticism,Religion,Science,Nonfiction,Cultural",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1181575016l/1166336.jpg,195078829,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1166336.Believing_in_Magic,272,3.72,11,Believing in Magic: The Psychology of Superstition,98
Janet Todd,"From the Romantic period's star circle, the story of its saddest casualty--Fanny Wollstonecraft, daughter of an original feminist, sister of a literary star, and hopeful object of a poet's affection, dead of suicide at the age of nineteen. , Little contemporary information was written about Fanny Wollstonecraft, whose mother Mary Wollstonecraft's scandalous life scarred Fanny's possibilities before she was even born. Deserted by her father, yet reared by Mary's husband William Godwin, Fanny barely had a chance to adjust when her mother died from giving birth to the legitimate and lovely Mary. Fanny was always considered the ungainly one, the plain one, the less intelligent one. Finally her imagination was sparked by the arrival of Percy Bysshe Shelley to the Godwin household. Her infatuation was quickly shattered when Shelley, like so many before him, chose the company of her sister instead, and though Fanny bore this rejection bravely, she was never quite the same after Mary and Shelley eloped along with her step-sister Claire--who would later track down and seduce Lord Byron. , Awash in a sea of sexual radicals, Fanny acted as personal assistant and go-between to this den of hedonists, shuttling information from one faction to the other, covering her sister's lies and creating fabrications of her own. She ultimately ended her life alone in a Welsh seaside hotel, an empty bottle of laudanum and an unsigned note by her side. , Janet Todd's meticulously researched and brilliantly told rendering of this life give fresh and fascinating insight to the Shelley-Byron world even as it draws Fanny out of the shadows of her mother's and sister's stunning careers.","Biography,History,Nonfiction,Medievalism,Romanticism,Historical,European Literature,British Literature,Womens,Historical,Regency,Criticism,Literary Criticism,Mental Health,Mental Illness",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1328744716l/1166343.jpg,1582433399,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1166343.Death_and_the_Maidens,297,3.89,27,Death and the Maidens: Fanny Wollstonecraft and the Shelley Circle,158

Laura Sessions Stepp,"An eye-opening examination of the hookup culture, seen through the personal experiences of high school-and college-age women who confront the hard lessons of dating, love, and sex. We're living in an increasingly sexualized world, and it's the young-particularly young women-who must deal with the consequences. Kids are having more sexual contact than ever, and at an earlier age. They call it ""hooking up."" But what is ""hooking up""? According to Laura Sessions Stepp, a reporter at ""The Washington Post,"" hooking up eludes a neat definition. It can be anything from an innocent kiss to sexual. In ""Unhooked,"" Stepp follows three groups of young women (one in high school, one each at Duke and George Washington universities). She sat with them in class, socialized with them, listened to them talk, and came away with some disturbing insights, including that hooking up carries with it no obligation on either side. Relationships and romance are seen as messy and time-consuming, and love is postponed-or worse, seen as impossible. Some young women can handle this, but many can't, and they're being battered-physically and emotionally-by the new dating landscape. The result is a generation of young people stymied by relationships and unsure where to turn for help. ""The need to be connected intimately to others is as central to our well-being as food and shelter,"" Stepp writes in ""Unhooked."" ""In my view, if we don't get it right, we're probably not going to get anything else in life right.""","Nonfiction,Psychology,Relationships,Feminism,Sexuality,Sociology,Social Science,Gender,Parenting,Feminism,Womens Studies",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1434990953l/116636._SY475_.jpg,1594489386,https://goodreads.com/book/show/116636.Unhooked,288,3.55,162,"Unhooked: How Young Women Pursue Sex, Delay Love, and Lose at Both",913

Ali Abunimah,"A ""visionary""* approach to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict--one state for two peoples--that is more urgent than ever,It is by now a commonplace that the only way to end the Israeli-Palestinian violence is to divide the territory in two. All efforts at resolving the conflict have come down to haggling over who gets what: Will Israel hand over 90 percent of the West Bank or only 60 percent? Will a Palestinian state include any part of Jerusalem?,Clear-eyed, sharply reasoned, and compassionate, ,One Country, proposes a radical alternative: to revive the neglected idea of one state shared by two peoples. Ali Abunimah shows how the two are by now so intertwined--geographically and economically--that separation cannot lead to the security Israelis need or the rights Palestinians must have. Taking on the objections and taboos that stand in the way of a binational solution, he demonstrates that sharing the territory will bring benefits for all.,The absence of other workable options has only led to ever- greater extremism. It is time, Abunimah argues, for Palestinians and Israelis to imagine a different future and a different relationship.","Politics,Nonfiction,History,Cultural,Israel,Literature,Jewish,War",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1390077674l/1166452.jpg,805086668,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1166452.One_Country,227,4.24,39,One Country: A Bold Proposal to End the Israeli-Palestinian Impasse,258

Ethelyn Simon,"The First Hebrew Primer is a simple, straightforward guide to Biblical Hebrew. Thirty lessons provide enough information and practice to enable you, with the aid of a Hebrew-English dictionary, to understand most biblical texts. The goal of the Primer is to teach students to read and understand Biblical Hebrew as quickly as possible; therefore, the lessons emphasize recognition and translation - not memorization. The thirty lessons incorporate: ,Verb, grammar, and spelling charts , Vocabulary lists , Oral reviews , Exercises , Stories , Biblical quotes , Book of Ruth ,This revised third edition introduces several new terms and clarifies grammatical points, but will look the same to long-time Primer readers. The key change we have made is the inclusion of new explanatory endnotes. Many readers have expressed a desire to deepen their knowledge of Biblical Hebrew, but have unanimously endorsed the clear, uncomplicated tone of the Primer. We have responded by adding these optional supplementary notes. Students may read the notes to enrich their understanding of Hebrew grammar or concentrate solely on the main text. Either way, the Primer provides a sound foundation for more advanced studies in the Hebrew Bible.","Religion,Judaism,Nonfiction,Reference,Humanities,Language,Literature,Jewish,Religion",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1181576680l/1166512._SX318_.jpg,939144158,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1166512.The_First_Hebrew_Primer,401,4.18,10,The First Hebrew Primer: The Adult Beginner's Path to Biblical Hebrew,145

What went wrong? Why wasn't my prayer answered? he asks. It is no longer an abstract question to me. What should we do and how should we respond when our prayers--prayers that seem right and true and good--go unanswered? In When God Doesn't Answer Your Prayer, Sittser continues exploring the issues he addressed in A Grace Disguised. He asks, Why doesn't God answer our prayers? What, if anything, can we do about it?

In this thoughtful and beautifully written book, he moves beyond easy answers and religious formulas to explore the goodness and greatness of a God who cannot be controlled but can be trusted.","Christian,Prayer,Religion,Faith,Spirituality,Christian,Christian Living,Religion,Christianity,Religion,Theology,Nonfiction",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1327126521l/1166621.jpg,310243262,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1166621.When_God_Doesn_t_Answer_Your_Prayer,206,4.22,38,When God Doesn't Answer Your Prayer,170
Rusty Russell,"Can the church truly be the ""city on a hill that cannot be hidden"" that Jesus talked about in the Sermon on the Mount? Can it grow large enough to attract throngs of seekers and yet be loving enough to care for each individual that comes? , Bob Russell, pastor of Southeast Christian Church -- one of the largest and fastest growing churches in America -- says that it most certainly can. But it can only be done when we are submissive to God's will and allow Him to build that church. In the pages of this far-sighted, uncompromising book, Bob Russell and his son Rusty share the ten principles upon which this remarkable church was founded. Throughout the book, you will see God's mighty power at work in a church that began in 1962 with only 50 members and has now grown to over 14,000 and has become a bustling ""city on a hill"" whose beaming faith powerfully impacts its community and the world. This book shares not only the story of one of the most amazing churches in America but also the story of what your church can become as you follow these ten time-tested principles and allow God to build your church.","Religion,Christianity,Christianity,Ecclesiology",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1427985534l/1166622.jpg,158229125X,https://goodreads.com/book/show/1166622.When_God_Builds_a_Church,304,4.11,6,When God Builds a Church,44

Stephen C. Stearns,"This book is the first comprehensive summary of life-history evolution, a field that holds a central position in modern ecology, evolution, and population biology. The book offers an up-to-date description of the analytical tools used in evolutionary explanation: demographics, quantitative genetics, reaction norms, trade-offs, and phylogenetic/comparative analysis. It goes on to discuss the evolution of such major life-history traits as age and size at maturity; clutch size, reproductive investment and size of offspring; reproductive lifespan; and aging. This is an essential text for biologists wishing to understand the evolution of the life cycle and the causes of phenotypic variation in fitness. It is additionally the only book available designed specifically for teaching the subject, with problems and discussion questions at the end of each chapter.","Science,Biology",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1417983971l/116672.jpg,198577419,https://goodreads.com/book/show/116672.The_Evolution_of_Life_Histories,264,4.71,0,The Evolution of Life Histories,14

Michael Nielsen,"In ,Reinventing Discovery,, Michael Nielsen argues that we are living at the dawn of the most dramatic change in science in more than 300 years. This change is being driven by powerful new cognitive tools, enabled by the internet, which are greatly accelerating scientific discovery. There are many books about how the internet is changing business or the workplace or government. But this is the first book about something much more fundamental: how the internet is transforming the nature of our collective intelligence and how we understand the world.,Reinventing Discovery, tells the exciting story of an unprecedented new era of networked science. We learn, for example, how mathematicians in the Polymath Project are spontaneously coming together to collaborate online, tackling and rapidly demolishing previously unsolved problems. We learn how 250,000 amateur astronomers are working together in a project called Galaxy Zoo to understand the large-scale structure of the Universe, and how they are making astonishing discoveries, including an entirely new kind of galaxy. These efforts are just a small part of the larger story told in this book--the story of how scientists are using the internet to dramatically expand our problem-solving ability and increase our combined brainpower.,This is a book for anyone who wants to understand how the online world is revolutionizing scientific discovery today--and why the revolution is just beginning.","Science,Nonfiction,Science,Technology,History,Computers,Internet,Science,Computer Science,Reference,Research,Computer Science,Computers,Science,Popular Science,Internet,Web",https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1367221215l/11667578.jpg,691148902,https://goodreads.com/book/show/11667578-reinventing-discovery,264,3.94,60,Reinventing Discovery: The New Era of Networked Science,589
"Martín Rodolfo de la Peña,Maurice Rumboll","South America, though home to about one-third of the world's bird species and twice as many endemic families of birds as any other continent, has the world's sparsest population of birdwatchers. ""Birds of Southern South America and Antarctica"" illustrates and describes all the known species--more than 1,000 of them--in a vast swath of this underexplored birder's paradise, from Argentina, Chile, Bolivia, Paraguay, southern Brazil, and Uruguay to parts of Antarctica. Just some of the birds it covers are teals, tinamous, chachalacas, conebills, cuckoos, macaws, parakeets, parrots, penguins, nightjars, hummingbirds, ovenbirds, tyrants, and tanagers. The habitats range from torrid rainforests and cloudforests to grasslands, the world's driest desert, second highest mountain range, and ice caps.,The 97 color plates depict each species' male in breeding plumage, with the female and young often shown as well. On the facing page are concise textual descriptions of each species, highlighting not only salient physical features and behavioral patterns but the calls or songs of each.
